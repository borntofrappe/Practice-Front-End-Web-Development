# D3 Hacktoberfest Dashboard

<!-- Link to the work-in-progress pen right [here](). -->

## Preface

I recently registered in the #hacktoberfest initiative promoted by @github and @digitaloecean, among many players in the developer's industry. While the proposal did push me a little more out in the open, trying to actively contribute to other's people codebase, and documentation, it did so with the promise of a tee, and maybe stickers to boot.

While checking my progress in the initiative I did notice the visualizations could use some help, and my D3 skills could benefit from some additional practice.

Here's the one-two of this project:

- [ ] re-create the visualization highlighting the number of contributions across the days of the week.

  The pie chart used in this regard is not the most stimulating visualization, often creating a visual which is quite hard to read. A loollipop chart might detail a more understandable structure.

- [ ] re-create the visualization mapping the number of contributions since the beginning of the month.

  The area chart showcased on the website is actually quite a catch of a visualization. There are however a couple of minor tweaks which may improve its impact. At the top of my head, the inclusion of a tooltip whenever the visitor hovers on **any** section of the area chart, and not only on the small dots detailed in the individual data points.
