## Preface

Following up the experimental speed controller crafted [in the previous project](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/XOWWZV), and continuing with another episode in the JavaScript 30 course, I decided to fork the speed controller and remove the default controls, as to add my own buttons and input elements.

In the end, it came out to be quite the proud result. Here a couple things to note:

- I am perfectly aware that this design is completely flawed, as it targets only those visitors using a cursor. This was an exercise to experiment and learn more about JavaScript and events connected to the `video`, `button` and `input` elements.

- it really makes me wish I'd knewn about the `timeupdate` event sooner. There's a certain podcast application which could really use this nugget of event.
