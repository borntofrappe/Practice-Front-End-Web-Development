# Preface 

With this project I plan to create a simple way to alter the appearance of a standard picture.

For the particular effect, I was inspired by the computer display found in the presentation of the new operating system by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/macos/mojave-preview/).

Roughly at a third of the page, you can here find a computer with a option to alter the portrayed picture, from day to night.

Even if to a lesser extent, the project is out to replicate this described element of the page.
