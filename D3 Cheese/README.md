# D3 Cheese

Dashing visualization [live on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/KEOZmX).

## Preface

Inspired by an article @lemondefr (soon to be referenced), I set out to create a simple visualization to practice with the **D3** library. Given the lack of practice in the recent weeks, it is both a chance to apply the knowledge I acquired elsewhere and test the validity of my notes on the library.
