# Preface

One of the most challenging parts of the d3.js library, at least personally, is the creation of axes perfectly suited to represent the data passed through the library.

The difficult part of picking the right scale for the axes does not stem only from the documentation. Actually, the [documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale) does a pretty good job in explaining all possible values. The challenge mostly resides in the multiple format in which the data can be formatted. Multiple choices regarding the format and the available axes means that it is not easy to pick the right solution without first spending some time experimenting. 

With this small pen I plan to 1) practice with the available axes to display a wide range of data formats and 1) create a small reference for future works with the library.

If done right, the project can function as a visual to easily match the type of data with the most suited configuration for scale and axes.
