# Front-End File Metadata

## Preface

With this project I set out to create the UI for the soon to be fifth and final project for the **API and Microservices** certification @freecodecamp.

The UI is set to incorporate a few instructions on the purpose of the page:

- choose a file;

- upload it to have it analysed.

As a matter of fact, the instructions can be summed up by the input elements required by the application. No need to actually incorporate additional text-based elements.

With this in mind, the application will show:

- two input elements to achieve the application's functionalities;

- an additional container to detail a small animation, built around the idea of processing files.

The general look is inspired by [this dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/4852210-Copying).
