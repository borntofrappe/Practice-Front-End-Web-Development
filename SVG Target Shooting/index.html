  <title>SVG Target Shooting</title>

    <!-- 
      the new cursor is represented by a circle with four "ticks" positioned at all main cardinal points (norht, east and so forth)
      the path element allows to draw even multiple segments by including the Z command, which ends a path, and following up with a M command, which moves the SVG to a new coordinate from which to start a new segment 
      the effect can also be achieved by giving a solid fill to the circle and positioning it after the path element (remember SVG elements are stacked with later elements on top of previous ones)
