# Preface

Out of a bit of frustration with D3.js, but mostly inspired by Wes Bos recent slideshow on CSS grid, I wanted to practice with React.js, while creating exactly a slideshow. 

The project will provide a series of slides,  following one another and each occupying the entirety of the viewport. 

The slides, instead of providing some boilerplate text, will include some introductory information on React.js itself, for good practice.

The main component will show the slide and a controller, used to "flip" between slides.
