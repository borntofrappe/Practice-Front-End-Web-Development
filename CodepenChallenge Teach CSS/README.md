## Preface

For the weekly #codepenchallenge, and the topic of teaching a CSS concept, I wanted to take advantage of the `contenteditable` property, which allows to style any HTML element directly on the page.

This while trying to progressively build a CSS animation, taking care of a few animation principles like anticipation, drag, but mostly timing. 

A good excuse to practice with CSS animation, the `animation` property, the `keyframes` keyword and anything in between. Including an excursion in JavaScript land.
