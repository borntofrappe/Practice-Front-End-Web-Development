## Preface

Inspired by a recent pen [drawing with CSS](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/jvxKgL) and a loading screen provided by [Tinycards](https://tinycards.duolingo.com), this small project sets out to replicate the loader to tinker with CSS properties and specifically CSS animation.

Good practice with Stylus and CSS animation.
