## Preface

The purpose of this project is to replicate a section of the neat website [Coda.io](https://coda.io/welcome). As the visitor scrolls past the terminal interface, he/she is presented with a green-ish section with bold text and glowing icons. Icons which are animated to rotate and change in opacity.

It is this exact effect that this small project is trying to replicate. It is a good excuse to practice with SVG assets, included in a set and referenced through the page, and also experiment with CSS animation**s** and CSS variables.

It is indeed possible to include more than one animation for any CSS selectors, as it will be briefly explained. It is even possible to customize each animation by changing a set of defined variables.
