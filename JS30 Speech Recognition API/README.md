## Preface

One of the hopefully more teaching and entertaining projects in the #javascript30 course, this project is tasked with the exploration and use of the Web Speech API.

## Update Day 1 - 28/01/2019

I decided to spend the first day in crafting the UI of the application. This has allowed me to tinker with a simple CSS drawn icon to craft a rather pleasing design. I don't seem to immediately be able to consider the input from the SpeechRecognition instance, but I don't know whether it has something to do with my microphone or my lack of practice with the library.
