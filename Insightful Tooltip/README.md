# Preface

As I was watching a video from the Formula 1 channel on the pilots' reaction to the latest grand prix's qualifying session, I saw a rather neat tooltip pop up from the bottom of the screen, as one of the riders was discussing his progress. You can see it [right here](https://youtu.be/VFn1zqLsUPQ?t=3m21s). It is a really a neat solution to provide additional insights or trivia. It can be distracting though, and that is likely the reason such a visual is used quite sparingly, and with short, concise sentences.

Nevertheless, a design which I thought would be cool and useful to replicate.
