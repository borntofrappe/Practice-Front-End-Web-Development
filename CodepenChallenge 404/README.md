## Preface

A new month, a new set of projects for the #codepenchallenge.

The month's topic: HTTP status codes.

The week's detail: 404 error code.

## Idea

Partly inspired by [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and more generally spurred by a genuine interest in SVG, I wanted to create the following vector-based animation:

- as the visitor hops on the page, he/she is greeted by the 404 error page. This is built with simple vector shapes, be them rounded rectangles and straightforward circles. The page should present the 404 number boldly and horizontally centered.

- after a brief moment, enough for the visitor to see the 404, but not enough to consider the entirety of the page, the visual should completely become black.

- on hover, the visitor uses its cursor as a light, visualizing the page one small section at a time.

Hopefully the idea is clear enough to be 1. easily grasped and 2. correctly implemented.
