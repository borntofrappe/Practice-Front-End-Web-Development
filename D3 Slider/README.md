## Preface

Inspired by [this visualization @lemondefr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2018/11/22/cinquante-ans-d-occupation-illegale-comment-l-etat-israelien-encourage-la-colonisation-de-la-cisjordanie_5386842_4355770.html), I set out to create a simple slider to enhance a line chart.

Ideally I'd replicate the entire visualization, including the connected geomap sitting below the line chart, but one step at a time.

Turns out, managing the coordinate system requires a bit of research. Certainly demanding more time than currently available. Work-in-progress.
