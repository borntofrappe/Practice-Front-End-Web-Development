# D3 Force

<!-- Link to the work-in-progress pen right [here](). -->

## Brief

Practice with the data visualization library to display network information connected to the technology powering every pen [@codepen](https://codepen.io).

## Getting Started

The data for the _network diagram_ (or otherwise labeled _graph_), relates to the technology powering each pen on codepen, as mentioned in the brief. In detail, and in the settings tab, the technologies can be listed as follows:

- HTML;

- CSS;

- JavaScript.

Each is further refined through the following _preprocessors_:

- HTML:

  - Haml;

  - Markdown;

  - Slim;

  - Pug.

- CSS:

  - LESS;

  - SCSS;

  - Sass;

  - Stylus,

  - PostCSS.

- JavaScript:

  - Babel;

  - TypeScript;

  - CoffeeScript;

  - LiveScript.

## Development

As far as `script.js` is concerned, the _graph_ is created through the **d3 force** suit of functions.
