# Preface 

The purpose of this project is the creation of simple curves with SVG syntax. Coded by hand instead of manufactured with editing software like inkscape.

I got inspired by several uses of SVG to delimit different sections of a page. To create a subtle separation between sections/div elements, I figured I could refresh my knowledge of bezier curves to create waves spanning the entirety of the screen.

The arcs and animation of supporting SVG elements were just a nice add-on I figured I could include as an after-thought.
