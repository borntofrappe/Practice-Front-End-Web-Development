# SVG Experiments

Link to the working pen [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/OqwREx).

## Preface

This is a rather straightforward project to achieve a couple results, both conncted to SVG elements. This to replicate two rather eye-catching features implemented online [on css triks]() and on [Rob Weychert's own blog](https://v6.robweychert.com/):

- a semicircle positioned below a profile picture;

- a clip shaped in the outline of a brush stroke.

Elements used in the project, and seldom used before:

- `mask`;

- `clipPath`;

- `image`.

Using both VScode and Inkscape.
