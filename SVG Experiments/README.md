# SVG Experiments

## Preface

This is a rather straightforward project to achieve a couple results, both conncted to SVG elements. This to replicate two rather eye-catching features implemented online [on css triks]() and on [Rob Weychert's own blog](https://v6.robweychert.com/):

- a semicircle positioned below a profile picture;

- a clip shaped in the outline of a brush stroke.
