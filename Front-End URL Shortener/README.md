## Preface

This project sets out to create the UI for the homepage of what eventually will become a functioning back-end project. I decided to keep in line with the UI created so far for the node projects, and use the homepage to instruct on the functionality behind the application.

This time around, the project simply answers a few questions about the project in a card format, on top of a gradient possibly inspired by the slides created by Wes Bos, as in [these slides](https://wesbos.github.io/Whats-New-In-React/#14).
