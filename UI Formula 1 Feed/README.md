# Formula 1 Feed UI

## Preface

I am in the process of developing a dashboard, with React and inspired by the lap by lap updates given by the F1 website for every race weekend's. With this simple HTML-CSS based project I set out to create the components ultimately spit out from said dashboard.

For reference, the UI is absolutely inspired by the F1 website itself, as visible [right here](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.live-coverage-formula-1-gran-premio-de-mexico-2018.RxEqYqq6seouW4sOSUuw0.html).
