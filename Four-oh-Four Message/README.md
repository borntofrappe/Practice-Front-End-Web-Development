# Preface 

Yesterday I found an error page when looking for a youtube video. This inspired the creation of an SVG asset resembling the monkey found in this exact page.

This finally spurred the creation of a small error page, presenting a red-hatted, hammer-wielding monkey and a simple CSS animation.

Nothing more to say than that.
