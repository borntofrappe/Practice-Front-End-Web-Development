## Preface

The purpose of this project is to create a navigation bar primed for mobile experience. Which means, the navigation bar ought to display only the items strictly necessary and a toggle option to display additional results.

The design behind the navigation bar in question takes inspiration, sometimes a tad too much, from [Nugget.one](https://nugget.one/). 

That being said, the SVG are manufactured, optimized and included-in house. The effect is also achieved in a different fashion, with a perhaps less-than-optimal implementation. The goal is, as usual, to draw inspiration from something neat-looking and trying to implement the found construct.
