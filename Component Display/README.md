# Preface 

The purpose of this project is to replicate but one feature of the extremely well designed web page for [Stripe Billing](stripe.com/billing). In particular, the project sets out to emulate the display which is repeated throughout the page, with different information detailing the product/service. Indeed in the page it is possible to find these containers with information, which is often animated, but these are not image assets, nor video elements. These are containers built, or at least which can be built, with simple HTML markup and CSS styling.

In this perspective, the project sets out to achieve exactly that. A markup document and a stylesheet making up a neat display that is all but a component for a larger project.

This component-structure is beneficial in different ways:

- it is possible to place the component anywhere in the page. Rotate it, translate it, any way you want to fit the component in the larger architecture.
- it is possible to animate the component and its smaller, bite-size pieces simply through CSS properties, of animation and transition.

This properties can be immediately triggered, as it will be for the simple focus of the project, but can also be triggered in response to some event. The inclusion of a JS script enables plenty of opportunities (which are here not covered, but may be the focus of future challenges).

# The plan

- [ ] with flex properties, create the outline of the card. Center it in the page, but know that you can freely manouver the component with `transform` properties.
- [ ] at the top of the card, place an elment on top of the card itself, with a circle and an image instructing about the utility of the card itself.
- [ ] in the card itself, place a title container with the title of the card and a quick description/specification right underneath it
- [ ] following the title in a single column layout, present detailed information in a table structure. Build the table with flex properties.
- [ ] bask in the achievement, and feel free to spruce up the interface with properties like `border-radius`, `drop-shadow` and a selection of colors.
- [ ] experiment with the component's possibilities. Rotate/translate the object for large screen devices, animate the title and table introducing the information one row.
