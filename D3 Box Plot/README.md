## Preface

In my quest to master D3.js, I was once more inspired by [Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/). This rather helpful website provides heaps of possible visualizations, from established and already implemented layouts to new and intriguing choices.

For the relatively small exercise of the day, I decided to pick and plot a box plot. This proved to be a good pretext to practice with the data driven library and SVG syntax.
