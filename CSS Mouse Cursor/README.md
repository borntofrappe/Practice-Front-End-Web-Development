# Preface 

Yesterday I tinkered with media queries and multiple breakpoints. Breakpoints at which...point displayed a different graphic on screen.

For "medium" screen sizes, I plotted a simple frame for a computer, and included a mouse pointer with an SVG asset. I wasn't that proud with this choice. It was a quick fix after a long night and I felt a little cheap for going with it.

So I decided to dedicate a small pen to re-create a mouse pointer with HTML and CSS. A mouse pointer which actually substitutes the default cursor and tracks the movement around the page to update its position.

It didn't take me that long, so I decided to then add a simple animation for a click event. After that I spent a silly amount of time researching a nice color for the background, which somehow feels superfluous. However, I am certainly more proud of this result than yesterday's small effort.

**Not so small note**

As the project relies on the mouse cursor, it does not account for mobile devices. That being said, clicking on the screen does update the position of the made-up cursor. It'd be neat to handle a drag event.
