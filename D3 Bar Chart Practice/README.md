## Preface

I am quite entertained by the data visualizations showcased on the French newspaper [le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/).

In a recent article on the [decline of hunting licenses](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2018/08/29/sur-1-1-million-de-chasseurs-moins-de-10-possedent-un-permis-national_5347594_4355770.html), it was possible to find several instances of such visualizations, which I try to here replicate.

One of the included sources, the [Federal Association of Hunters](http://chasse.bipe.fr/#/Chasseurs), has also quite a few inspiring visualizations, from the pie chart with slices glowing on hover, to bar chart showcasing multiple columns side by side (divided in categories).

In the website it is also possible to find particularly intriguing maps. That being said, this insightful visualizations will be the topic of a separate, dedicated project.

For the project at hand, I will simply replicate the design of two bar charts from the referenced article. The article itself showcases plenty more bar charts, but they follow the mold of the picked ones.

I also referenced the source website as this one provides plenty of useful data, in CSV format, and the data for the specific effort.
