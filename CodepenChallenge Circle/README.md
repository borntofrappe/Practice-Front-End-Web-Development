# CPC Perfect Circle

For the first installment in the February Challenges @codepen, and inspired by the #javascript30 course, I decided to once more to have fun with a technology with which I am not acquainted, trying to mix fun with learning.

The weekly topic is around the shape of a circle, pun intended, and my personal take on the subject sets out to achieve the following:

- present a canvas in which a circle is drawn in the right center of the frame;

- ask the visitor to draw a circle matching the perfect one as clearly as possible;

- once an attempt has been registered, evaluate the effort by considering the overlap between the two shapes.

Solid practice with the canvas element.
