# CPC Science

With the last #codepenchallenge for the month of March, devoted to science, I decided to pick one of the topics I most remember from Biology class: Mendel's law of segregation. With this effort, I set out to posit the law in a very simplistic manner: show two plants with a certain trait, proceed to breed a new plant which _inherits_ from the parents' genes.
