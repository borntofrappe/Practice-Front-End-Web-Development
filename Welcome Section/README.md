# Preface 

The purpose of this byte-size project folder is to create yet another component for the upcoming portfolio page. 
This time, instead of a navigation bar, I planned and built a section for a welcome message.

The section is divided in two, with an image and some next positioned right next to it.

By default, the two are one next to the other. 
Moreover, the image is made a circle and the text is positioned around said circle, through the property of `shape-outside` set to `circle()`.

Under a determined breakpoint, around 400px, the layout is modified to display the image atop the text,

Above a specified breakpoint, around 1400px, the font-size is increased to make it more prominent in light of the increasing space.
