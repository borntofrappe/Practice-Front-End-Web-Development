## Preface

In the JavaScript30 course, there are few lessons focusing entirely on JavaScript. These lessons can be completed directly in the JS console of a Chrome browser, and therefore do not need an HTML and CSS file to frame them.

While that holds true, and to practice with HTML and CSS as well, I decided to complete the lessons and also create a visual for them. For the first video in the line of **Array Cardio**, I decided to go for a simple panel, using `details` element to present the different challenges. The structure is simple: in the `summary` element the challenge is introduced with the task to be achieved with array methods; in the rest of the `details` element the return value of the code fulfilling the assignment is displayed.

The solutions are actually in the `script.js` file, and in here you can find a bit more than the simple methods completing the challenges. But those methods are indeed included, and do work (they are actually used to inject the content in the panel after all).
