## Preface

This is the first of perhaps two projects I intend to pursue with the Web Speech API, following the docs from MDN, which you can find [right here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API), and a couple videos from @websos, and his #javascript30 course, which I'll link to it later, as I review the content.

Apparently, the API is made up of two parts: SpeechSynthesis and SpeechRecognition. Both offer exciting opportunities, in text-to-speech and speech recognition applications. With this specific effort, I plan to tacle the first, using the SpeechSynthesis API to create a very simple interface in which any text displayed in a _textarea_ element is recited verbatim back to the visitor.
