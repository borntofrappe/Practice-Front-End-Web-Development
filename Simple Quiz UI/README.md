# Simple Quiz UI

## Preface

This is a rather simple project, yet an effective use of a coding session.

I intended to practice with React and Redux, and while I polished a few notes in preparation of a full-blown project, I was hampered by a few issues with **npm**. The project I had in mind was a quiz, absolutely inspired by [this article @lemondefr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2018/10/25/quiz-les-questions-pas-si-betes-que-vous-vous-posez-en-hiver_5374567_4355770.html). Having translated the questions and asnwered, I still wanted to create something connected to the project at hand (to cement the project in my mind, and avoid a few gripes with npm from stopping the development altogether). I therefore decided to develop the UI of the project. Nothing fancy, just a neat solution:

- making use of a `serif` font;

- creating custom indicators for the ordered list;

- tinkering with a couple of lines of JavaScript.
