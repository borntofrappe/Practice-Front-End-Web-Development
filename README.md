# Practice-Front-End-Web-Development

**What?**

Repository in which to experiment with simple front-end concepts. Detailing efforts in the land of:

- HyperText Markup Language (HTML);

- Cascading StyleSheet (CSS and pre-processors);

- JavaScript (JS);

- Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG);

- React (React.js and connected libraries);

- Data Driven Documents (D3.js and SVG syntax).

And hopefully more in the future.

**When?**

Whenever inspiration strikes, but periodically. There's nothing better than practice to fully understand and harness new concepts.
