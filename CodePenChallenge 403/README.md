## Preface

For the weekly codepenchallenge, I had a couple of ideas. Both of which were already deployed far better than I could have ever done in the first two days of the week. Exemplary projects popped up each day with very inspiring designs, so I was left with little to work with. Until I decided to maybe move away from the common theme the projects seemed to share.

The topic of the week is the 403 status code, standing for access not granted. Instead of displaying such instance through a stylish page portraying the forbidden nature of the message, I decided to work on a page displaying the error and offering a solution to fix it. Eventually.

What I have in mind is a pen which could be labeled "Persistance is ðŸ”‘". Simply put:

- as you enter the page you are introduced to the status code, possibly by an animated character. The animated nature of this character ought to convey a waiting period, with something along the lines of tapping fingers/ a tapping foot.

- after a predefined threshold, the character should be made saying, or the screen ought to be made displaying an update message. Something along the lines of "You are quite the persistent, you know that?"

- after another threshold another message should finally present a turning message. Something along the lines of "Oh well, here's a key for you". At this point, a token, or access code should be given, solving the status code.
