# Preface 

The purpose of this project is to participate in the weekly challenge proposed by CodePen, in which a topic is chosen and a front-end, web related concepts is created with that regard.

This week topic: the retro video-game Donkey Kong, featuring the infamous monkey and the stereotypical plumber, among few other characters.

With this in mind, the goal of the particular project folder is  to create a loading screen animation inspired by the video-game and one of my favourite characters in it.

Hopefully, it makes for something nice.

# Plan

- [x] build the pixellated flame with Inkscape;
- [x] include the SVG inline in the HTML document;
- [x] animate the flame to move from left to right and back on top of a loading text
- [x] bonus points: animate the flame with a pace defined by a random function. Within a range, the animation should appear faster/slower by accident;
- [x] extra bonus points: animate also the loading text.
