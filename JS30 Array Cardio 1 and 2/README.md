# Array Cardio

## Preface

Following the first session of array cardio, and most importantly following the readonly code editor I created to exactly display said cardio, I went through the second session of exercises and updated the editor to show both sets.

In here you find, safely tucked in `<details>` element, the data and the exercises for the two sessions. Extra bonus points: the snippets detailed in each makeshift markdown file are actually the snippets producing the result in the dedicated section.
