## Preface

For the weekly #codepenchallenge and the chosen topic, teaching HTML, I discovered a couple of HTML elements on the [MDN reference page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element), in [`<map>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map) and [`<area>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) which offer quite some promise. Together, I believe these elements have the potential to include an exciting arrow in the quiver of possibilities allowed by the markup language.

Enough metaphors though. The purpose of this project is to:
<!--  -->
1. understand the chosen elements;

1. understand the elements well enough to explain them to somebody else;

1. explain the elements with a practical project. This while possibly incorporating a step-by-step, or otherwise guided experience leading up to a full-fledged practical, usable, neat example.
