## Preface

With this project I plan to plot a geographical representation of the European Union, detailing for a few major countries their expenditures in the education sector.

The project is completely inspired by [this article @lemondefr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2017/08/29/islande-danemark-et-suede-champions-des-depenses-d-education-en-europe_5178058_4355770.html) and takes advtange of the data provied by [Eurostat right here](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/fr/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20170828-1?inheritRedirect=true&redirect=%2Feurostat%2Ffr%2Fnews%2Fwhats-new).
