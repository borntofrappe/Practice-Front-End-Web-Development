## Preface

The [third video](https://youtu.be/AHLNzv13c2I) in the #javascript30 course describes a powerful feature in the interplay between CSS custom properties and JavaScript logic.

With this project I set out to practice with the concept as to create a UI which can be modified according to a few property value pairs.

Good practice not only with JavaScript, but perhaps most importantly with CSS.
