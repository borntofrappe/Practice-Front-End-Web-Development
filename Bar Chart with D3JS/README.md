# Preface 

The purpose of this project is to experiment first hand with the D3.js JavaScript library, which allows to easily represent data in a webpage.

Specifically, the project is tasked to create a bar chart in which portions are drawn proportionally to the unerlying data points. The bar should be transitioned from a point of zero height to their respective dimension.

# Plan

- [x] include the d3.js library
- [x] include a header describing the project
- [x] include an SVG element in which to draw the chart
- [x] include one rectangle for each data point 
- [x] add a title and perhaps a text element describing each portion of the chart
- [x] bonus points: animate the chart, from hidden to full-scale

For the project at hand, work with a hard-coded series on values which are stored in an array, but theoretically you could include the option of alterning the values through an input element. Something about which to wonder for possible extensions.  


# Lessons Learned

Include notes on the d3.js library, how to include elements, data and how to transition elements.
