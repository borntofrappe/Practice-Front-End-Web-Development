# Preface

The purpose of this project is to implement a design choice as last seen on [Picture This AI.com](https://www.picturethisai.com/). As the visitor scrolls through the page, he/she is faced with an array of information and graphics. Graphics which are made to scroll with a "parallax" effect. Instead of letting the image scroll as it normally would, the page indeed scrolls past the images, which are seemingly fixed on the page.

It is a neat effect, especially if implemented with measure. By placing too many images and fixed element, the design can get noxious quite fast. By I presume that is a trait of most design choices. Abuses are just as reprehensible as the absence of design choices at all.
