## Preface

This project simply sets out to create a form, a straightforward form including multiple input elements. It is part of a larger effort in the creation of a working form, making use of **Node.js** to render the values of the input elements in a separate page.

That being said, the design of the form is carefully chosen, as to leave nothing to chance.
