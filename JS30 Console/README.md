# JS30 Console

Proud result live, [right here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/YBQpxy).

## Preface

With this project I plan to take inspiration from [this video](https://youtu.be/xkzDaKwinA8) in the #javascript30 course, specifically the tips regarding `console` statement, and repeat the lessons learned in this video through a nice visual.

I want to specifically take the `console.log()`, but also `.warn()`, `.error()` methods and re-create their basic functionality, through a custom made console.

Simply put, the project is structured as follows:

- a panel on the left allows to receive user input in the form of simple commands (such as `c.log('something')`);

- a panel on the right takes those commands and relates the information in the appropriate format. In the form of text, with icons or other signifiers distinguishing between the possible methods.

Basically I plan to create a very dumbed out version of a console, which allows to work with very simple values. At a later stage of development, I could see this concept evolve into a friendly companion, which could be potentially used in the development of other projects. I can see it as a nice interface for those functionalities of the console I use most often. Something about which to think about.
