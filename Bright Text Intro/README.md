# Preface

This project tries to replicate a neat animation as seen in the theme song introducing every episode of the pokemon series, in what can be presumably dubbed its second season.

Right toward the end of the theme song, the word pokemon is brought into scene in big bold letters and highlighted sequentially with bright shadows casted right behind the text, in three steps.

# Lessons Learned

The project in questions applies lessons learned from previous efforts:

- the background of the page is the result multiple gradients, overlayed one on top of another;
- the animation for the title occurs seemingly with pause between iteration;
- css variables are used to alter the values included in the animation;
- the SVG is absolute positioned, in relation to the subtitle, and animated thusly;
- the SVG is subject to two different animations, occurring at different stages.

It's a good excuse to practice with these concepts. Moreover, it is also a nice pretext to experiment with something new, such as **CSS filter** properties**
