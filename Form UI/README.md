# Form UI

Aesthetically pleasing UI available [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/dLPjpp).

## Preface

This project is but the first step in the first ever entry for the #weeklycodingchallenge.

The subject is [this particular design](https://dribbble.com/shots/5311359-Diprella-Login), and while I do want to implement the transition/animation feature, I decided to split the project in two efforts (at least). The first step is re-recreating the layout and overall look of the sign in/sign up form, which is precisely the topic of this sub-folder.

## Notes

The design is quite pleasing to the eye, and it sports quite a few intriguing additions. Such as:

- SVG shapes, not used only as a background, but also as overlay. This opens another door of opportunities;

- flex properties, allowing to rapidly and massively change the layout of the form with very few lines of code;

- using pseudo elements instead of solid borders to reduce the weight of the border without affecting the content (and without introducing another color).
