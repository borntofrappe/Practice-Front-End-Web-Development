# Preface 

I recently read a very interesting article on drawing with CSS. You can find it on CSS Tricks right at [this address](https://css-tricks.com/drawing-images-with-css-gradients/).

In this article, it is possible to learn how to draw simple shapes and larger structures with them, all with the `background` property and gradient values.

I decided to practice the technique and decided to replicate a few designs from the recent video-game titled "Pokemon Quest". I couldn't think of a better specimen to experiment with CSS drawing, and for several reasons:

- the game just came out on mobile devices, and has quite a fresh feel to it;
- the block-based design can be replicated with very simple shapes, mostly rounded rectangles. Perfect to getting started with CSS-background-based-drawing;
- the transition between game-phases, while at times annoyingly long, is rather pleasant to the eyes. Even with a grayscale screen.

I also find it helpful to pair delight and learning, but that is beyond the scope of the single game.

With all this preface, the project is out to replicate a couple of elements from the game:

- a small, block-y design of a poke-ball, positioned in the bottom left corner and animated to present a loading screen;
- a pokemon, always with the block-y pattern typical of the game, right in the middle of the screen.

Behind these very rudimentary drawings, it would also be neat to replicate the transition between game modes, which brings into and out of sight a delightful pattern based on gradients. Something to possibly add at a later moment.
