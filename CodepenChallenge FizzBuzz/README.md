# FIZZ BUZZ BLAST

## Preface

For the second week of April, @codepen proposes a challenge around the populat Fizzbuzz theme. Simply put, enumerate numbers, substituting **fizz** for every number divisible by 3, **buzz** for every number divisible by 5, **fizzbuzz** for both.

I decided to recreate the game by allowing input through a series of buttons and keyboard as well. Having fun with gradients and giant headers, while toying with event listeners.
