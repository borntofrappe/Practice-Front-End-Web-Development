# CodepenChallenge Wind

<!-- Live [right here](), on codepen -->

## Preface

I decided to create a belated entry for the last #codepenchallenge of the year. The month's theme: the four elements. The week's theme: wind.

Picking up D3 and hopefully soon real data regarding wind and its intensity throughout the year, I plan to create a very neat visualization, showing the windiest days for each month, in an extended network diagram. I have no idea if I can pull this off, or how, but I am pretty sure this will allow me to practice with `d3.simulation`, one way or another.

Small note: this is a **belated** entry, and regardless of how belated it might be, it will be pushed online. It might be out of bounds, but it is always a good pretext to practice with web development, in this particular D3 and data visualizations, and to participate once more to an initiative that has given so much during the year. An initiative I rather disregarded in the past weeks, but I plan to take up religiously and once more in the coming months.
