## Preface

In order to:

1. ease into a challenging weekend,

1. tinker with an animated CSS drawing

I set out to create a simple entry for the weekly #codepenchallenge. Predictably built around the dinosaur which appears when google loses a connection, this entry sees very little but the pixelated dinosaur. Once drawn, it will be animated after a key event on the spacebar or a click event, with a minor twist. Just like a spring, the more the click/keydown event are heard, the higher the dinosaur will jump.

Nothing too complicated. Hopefully.
