This app is currently being built through the `create-react-app` utiltiy. Link to a live pen will soon follow.

# Preface

Following the starting point achieved with the [previous pen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/jpqLer/), this project builds on top of the React application as to include the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). This to track and manage the state of the application while learning the popular library.

## React Tune Up

Before actually including [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), I decided to improve the style of the application. Indeed I found a few gotchas when testing out the previous output, and I wanted to include a more solid design for the final product.

CSS properties were included to 1) avoid unnerving overflow, 1) create a separate layout for devices holding a width smaller than 400px and 1) include a neat image when no item is present in the to-do list.
