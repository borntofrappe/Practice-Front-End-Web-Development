# D3 Practice

## Preface

Perhaps better labeled as D3 phamplet. With this at least two-days effort I plan to recreate [this visualization @lemondefr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2018/11/09/petit-manuel-a-lire-avant-de-debattre-de-la-hausse-des-prix-du-carburant_5381196_4355770.html). This allows me to practice with D3 as a whole, and trying to build a more complex visualizations. Good practice with D3 and as it turns out, SVG as well.
