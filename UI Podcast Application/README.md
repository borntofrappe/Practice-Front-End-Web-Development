# UI Podcast App

<!-- Working pen [right here]() -->

## Preface

In my react-practice series, I decided to create a functioning podcast application, retrieving information from an RSS feed to populate a few components with the audio and description of a certain podcast (freeCodeCamp, as a tribute for the great platform).

With this project, I sat down and create the general interface of the application. It is mostly HTML and CSS (even if I am using stylus for this last one). For added bonus, I included a few lines of JavaScript to actually start and pause the audio.

The biggest trickery was the timing to be displayed below the podcast application. Indeed, it is a bit of a hassle, but with a few if/else statements it is possible to retrieve the number of seconds and partition this value in hours, minutes and seconds.

That being said, the project remains about UI, and the simple design of the vinyl with the freeCodeCamp logo and play/pause button. SVG created without Inkscape, which I consider quite a small victory.
