# Preface 

Recently I got interested in game development. I figured it'd be a nice, parallel field in which to apply the knowledge I gathered so far on web development.

In any case, as I started looking around for beginner's guides, I came upon the 2D game engine _Loeve2D_. As I installed the program and launched it, I was greeted by an error message, informing me how the game engine actually requires a game to run. Who would have thought.

The error message was rather neat and so, while I still have to really dip my toe in the game-development pool, I was inspired to create a simple SVG-based animation. The goal, rather simple, to re-create the simple design showing a baloon floating in the air, while clouds scroll past behind it.

Update: in the end I spent quite a considerable chunk of the project actually drawing the SVG. Another sizeable component of the time which went in the development of the animation was taken by polishing the code, indenting the SVG syntax properly in a easy-to-understand structure.

While relatively little time has gone in the actual animation, introduced with SMIL and the `<animateTransform>` element, it was a nice diversion from a session purely dedicated on API, AJAX and JSON.
