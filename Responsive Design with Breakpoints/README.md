# Preface 

I started to read _Responsible Responsive Design_, a book by Scott Jehl. 
Immediately after a thoughtful consideration of breakpoints, I came up with the idea for this small project.

A project which is tasked to design, through HTML markup and CSS properties, different UI(s). 
A television, a computer, a tablet, a phone screen.

A project which then allows for these different UI(s) to be presented at different screen sizes, with media queries.

It'd be nice to have something displayed in the different screens, but the focus is on the devices more than the content they hold.

# Notes

The different devices vary wildly in the actual look they bear. That being said, it is possible to build them up thinking about their common traits. 
Thinking about the components they ubdoubtedly share. They all have a screen for instance, which is already a start. 

The frame might change in the roundness of its corner, the ratio of its dimension, but it is always a frame.
