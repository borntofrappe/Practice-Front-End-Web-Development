## Preface

With this project I set out to replicate the feature introduced @wesbos in this particular video of his JS30 course. The project is specifically my own take at how to achieve the desired result; it is clearly is an improvement from the previous effort with checkboxes, and I feel the code won't be that distant from the envisaged, expert solution.

The confidence I felt with the solution carried into the style of the simple project. Beside the carefully chosen color palette and the the use of the `transform` property, I was able to code a simple SVG icon for a mouse cursor, and use it in the background. Icon available in the **res** folder.

For reviewing purposes, here's the [video from Wes](https://youtu.be/C9EWifQ5xqA) solving the program. Learning is achieved by doing and later reviewing one's own approach.
