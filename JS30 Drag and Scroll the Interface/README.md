# JS30: Interface Challenge, Drag to Scroll

<!-- Proud result live [right here on codepen]() -->

## Preface

With this project I set out to replicate the feature introduced @wesbos in this particular video of his JS30 course. The project is specifically my own take at how to achieve the desired result; it is clearly is an improvement from the previous effort with checkboxes, and I feel the code won't be that distant from the envisaged, expert solution.
