## Preface

> Is there a storm with your name?

That is the query this search component is trying is trying to answer.

The project was particularly inspired by [this article @lemondefr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2017/09/07/irma-harvey-jose-comment-sont-nommes-les-ouragans_5182473_4355770.html), and to practice with React, not to mention JavaScript methods (immediately I can think of `array.filter()`, to display only the pertinent information below the `input` element).

In practice, the search is enacted only as the visitor types his, her, or somebody else's name in the `input` element. Based on the input's own value, one set of element for each one of the search result is displayed on the screen.
