# CodepenChallenge Peach

## Preface

For the first #codepenchallenge of the year, I decided to play around with the theme, and build something random around it.

The theme: three particular hex colors.

- #A2CCB6

- #FCEEB5

- #EE786E.

My personal take: a color wheel, with all but three random colors around it. Exactly those three colors. Spin the wheel and get a random color. Better yet, a "random" color.

Solid practice with SVG syntax and a bit of JavaScript logic.

## Minor Update

Upon looking at the UI a little more, I recognized a few areas of improvements. I decided to include a few dots around the circle, reduce the size of the circle and change the color of the background. I also decided to change the color of the circle element, and in so doing completely render slices with random colors.
