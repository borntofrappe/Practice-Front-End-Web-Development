# Follow Along Links

<!-- Proud result live [right here on codepen]() -->

## Preface

Continuing the [javascript30](https://youtu.be/POP_qri7RA8) course, I set out to create a simple project to highlight anchor link elments as they are hovered on or focused upon.

In the end the project took more time than expected, but not for the feasibility of the idea (in a nutshell, position a colored background behind the anchor link elments, moving it from one place to another). I devoted quite some time to the design, the layout of the application and small niceties with CSS and SVG. I got to use `preserveAspectRatio` once more (that's twice in two days) and even to leverage a simple `filter: blur(5px);` property-value pair.

All in all, learned a bit more about CSS and the positioning of HTML elements.
