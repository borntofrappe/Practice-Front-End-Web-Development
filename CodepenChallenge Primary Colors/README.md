## Preface

For the second week of the #codepenchallenge, the task is to create a pen with the three primary colors:

- red: #F44336;

- blue: #1E88E5;

- yellow: #FDD835.

My personal take is a simple 'canvas', made up of an SVG container and `circle` elements. These elements are used as droplets of paint, of the three specified hex values. The interaction with the canvas is rather straightforward: tap on a drop of paint, drag the newly created droplet anywhere within the boundaries of the SVG elements.
