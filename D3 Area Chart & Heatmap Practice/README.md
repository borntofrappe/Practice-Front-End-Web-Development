# D3 Area Chart and Heatmap Practice

## Preface

Wit this project I plan to pick up once more the visualization library D3.js. This while building something I've built before, for practice, but also to experiment with actual data and different takes on the same format.

The visualizations in question are:

- an area chart, with a few selectedd data points hihglighted through simple circle elements.

- a thermo-diagram, perhaps better labeled as a _heatmap_, detailing multiple squares side by side and with a different fill color. Fill color influenced by the value behind each data point.

The visualizations are inspired by [this article @lemondefr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2018/10/20/pourquoi-les-chiffres-mensuels-de-la-mortalite-routiere-doivent-etre-pris-avec-precaution_5372270_4355770.html), while the source data is collected from [this site on road safety](http://www.securite-routiere.gouv.fr/la-securite-routiere/l-observatoire-national-interministeriel-de-la-securite-routiere/series-statistiques).

The project in question is also an opportunity to tinker with a different layout. Indeed, inspired by the website where the data is found I think I can include a few design choices which I think nice:

- the label _L'observatoire national..._, with uneven borders and apparently wrapping around the connected panel;

- the repeating linear gradient, reminding the visitor of an actual road.

Perhaps minor elements, which certainly make a great job in portraying the subject matter.
