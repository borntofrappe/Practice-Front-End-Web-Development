# Preface 

This project was created to participate in the theme of the #codepenchallenge, a weekly endeavor by [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io) which asks developers to create web development concepts (from simple animations to complete interfaces) from a chosen genre.

The week challenge, which is the topic of this particular project, is the movie "You Got Mail" (1999).

For such a theme, a simple animation is created with an SVG asset and CSS animation properties. It is a trivial animation, which applies concepts already covered in other project.

Nonetheless, it is an animation which allows to 1) create a solution, a concept with a clear goal in mind and 2) an animation which dares to be shared to a slightly larger audience.

There's very little to add in the lessons learned section, as the project mostly depends on the construction of an SVG asset suited to be directly animated with CSS. Therefore, the only thing to be added in this regard is the following: one way to animate parts of an SVG file is to directly reference the `path` or `g`roup tags which make up the larger asset. By attributing a class or identifier, it is easy to apply CSS properties to achieve a desired effect.
