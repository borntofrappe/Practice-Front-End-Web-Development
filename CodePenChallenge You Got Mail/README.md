# Preface 

This project was created to participate in the weekly theme of the #codepenchallenge, a weekly endeavor by [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io) which asks developers to create web development concepts (from a simple animation to a complete interface) from a chosen genre.

The week challenge, which is the topic of this particular project, is the movie "You Got Mail" (1999).

For such a theme, a simple animation is created with an SVG asset and CSS animation properties. It is a trivial animation, which applies concepts already covered in other project.

Nonetheless, it is an animation which allows to create a solution, a concept with a clear goal in mind and an animation which dares to be shared to a slightly larger audience.

There's very little to add in the lessons learned section, as the project mostly depends on the construction of an SVG asset suited to be directly animated with CSS.
