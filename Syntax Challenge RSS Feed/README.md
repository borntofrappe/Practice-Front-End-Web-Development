## Preface

While listening to the 100th episode of [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/show/144/not-a-clip-show-episode-100), an extremely helpful and entertaining podcast on web development, I received input in the form of a challenge, thrown from the host of the podcast themselves.

The challenge: collect information from the RSS feed on the podcast to ultimately establish the duration of the lot, of the entirety of the 100 episode. In accepting the challenge, I got to practice with JavaScript concepts and a new source of data in the form of RSS feed.
