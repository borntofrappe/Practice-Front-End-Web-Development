# Readonly Code Editor

## Preface

Following [the pen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/WLqVyL) I created for the first day of array cardio, I decided to tinker once more with the way I present the exercises. I wanted to create a clear interface each challenge would present the working code and the output of the code itself.

I ended up recreating the UI of a code editor, with a panel allowing to display a series of makeshift JavaScript and Markdown logic.

The end result is, without bragging too much, one of the most visually appealing projects of late.
