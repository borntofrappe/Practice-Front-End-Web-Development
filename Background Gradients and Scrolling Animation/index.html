    <!-- 
      to create the scroll effect include a div element which will be transitioned into view 
      semantically, this means an additional element is placed in the HTML, but the div element is here
      an hypothetical placeholder for an image or other asset to be introduced in the boundaries of the parent element
      
      with .div only, the animation could be achieved by moving the background instead of the entire element...I presume
