## Preface

As I went through the first chapters of _Interactive Data Visualizations_, a very teaching book on the D3.js library, I found myself intrigued by creating data visualizations out of something ordinary like a `<div>` element. Previously, and mostly for the freeCodeCamp curriculum, I had always leveraged SVG to visualize my data. I never took what could be labeled as "beginner"'s step of using HTML elements, before leveling up to SVG syntax.

This project sets out to use `<div>` elements to cover such a gap. I think it's going to be an entertaining and teaching effort, allowing me to grasp even more the possibilities of the JavaScript library. 

In practice, the project plans to include a visualization to replicate the extremely motivating and impactful grid of contributions, as visible on [Github](https://blog.github.com/2013-01-07-introducing-contributions/). It would be neat, and it actually represents one of the priorities of the project, to include random data, as to include grid cells with varying intensity of green.
