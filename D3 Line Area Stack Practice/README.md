## Preface

With this project I plan to pick up once more the data driven library and practice with a line chart. An area chart actually.

This inspired by an article @lemondefr and using data from the French institute referenced in the article itself.

The article itself: an article on [French births, in and out of marriage](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2018/09/04/six-enfants-sur-dix-naissent-hors-mariage-en-france-un-record-en-europe_5350153_4355770.html).

The data: handily provided by [INSEE](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/3599508?pk_campaign=avis-parution).
