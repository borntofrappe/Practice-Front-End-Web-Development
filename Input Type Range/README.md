# Preface

With this project I want to tinker with the `input` element. Specifically, with the `input` element of `type="range"`. This effort may or may not be part of a larger project, but for the time being, it is simply an excuse to practice with the element and CSS properties.

You can categorize this project as "learning by creating something silly".
