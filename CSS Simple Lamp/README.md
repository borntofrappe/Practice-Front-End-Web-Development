# Preface 

Last week I glanced at a fan created on codepen. It was a neat fan. Since then, I thought about trying something similar. Something in the spirit of "drawing with CSS". Technically using a few HTML div elements, and a few lines of JavaScript to make the object responsive, this is my attempt at just that.

It is a silly, almost contrived example, but it allowed me to understand a few things regarding CSS positioning, both in terms of the position and z-index property.

Anything which allows me to learn, while at the same time creating something silly, but pleasant to look at, is well received.
