# Preface 

With this project I plan to practice with SVG and the JS library D3. This to create a pie chart, drawn on the screen and displaying different portions with patterns, created with the appropriate SVG syntax.

# Plan

- [x] look at the SVG syntax behind a circle and behind a portion of a circle;
- [x] figure out how to draw multiple portions, multiple slices of the pie chart as to make up one entire circle. The syntax might suggest the exact coordinates and values required to draw the slice, while maintaining the same center.
- [x] plug in the D3.js library and include arbitrary data in an array. Include something like four or five numbers.
- [x] based on the numbers found in the array, draw slices proportionate to the amount they represent. Differentiate the slices in color (fill)

# Notes

The project eventually took a big chunk of my day to be completed. Turns out, is not that easy to draw a slice of a circle. Not without delving a little into trigonometric functions that is.

Eventually, I built a neat JS script, which also allows for the creation of a new pie chart at the click of a button. In terms of style and responsiveness, the whole thing can be improved, but I am rather proud of the result.

It was an incredibly teaching project, especially in terms of SVG syntax and functional programming. I am starting to adopt this last approach for a more solid, flexible and overall usable codebase.
