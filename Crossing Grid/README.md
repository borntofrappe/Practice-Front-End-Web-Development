# Preface 

With this simple project I wanted to practice with a simple grid structure, using CSS grid properties to create a block-based layout.

For the complementary animation I was inspired by the GameCube title "Animal Crossing", so I tinkered a little more with CSS animation properties. Both for the text and the afore-mentioned grid structure.

Once I completed the structure, I realized how React would be a nifty solution to a simple problem: including 120 span elements.

Instead of actually having a rather repetitive HTML file, the framework allows to easily iterate through a for loop to inject however many elements are needed. The syntax is much more concise and easy to duplicate.

Indeed with the app refactored through React I included the grid layout thrice, with very little additional effort.
