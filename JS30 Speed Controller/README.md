# Experimental Speed Controller

## Preface

Continuing in the JS30 course, I set out to tackle project #28: building an experimental speed controller for a video element.

Upon picking up the reference to the video [from the repo](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/blob/master/28%20-%20Video%20Speed%20Controller/index-START.html), I created the feature starting from the same basic markup.

In the end, I was able to create the feature and focus on a simple SVG drawing. This allowed me to practice with transform properties in the context of an SVG coordinate system (it's not as simple as avoiding a comma here and there), and overall to acquire a new perspective on how to craft an SVG file.

I also got to tinker with a bit of math as to map the values from range to ranges. Solid practice session.

For reference, [here's the video](https://youtu.be/8gYN_EDMg_M) spawning the effort.
