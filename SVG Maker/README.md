# SVG Maker

## Preface

With this project I have but one goal: recreate some of the features of Inkscape, allowing me to create very simple vector-based graphics directly on the web.

Starting out with the possibility to draw:

- a line;

- a rectangle;

- a circle.

## Update

As it currently stands, the project allows to include the specified shapes and also:

- the possibility to delete all elements from the makeshift canvas;

- the possibility to change the color.

It has already been a teaching project, especially for the following notable mentions:

- `attr(data-something)`, a function which can be detailed in the CSS property of `content`;

- `[min, max] = [one, two].sort(...)` allowing to easily sort and destructure the variables in two variables, to easily separate the two according to the respective value.
