## Preface

I was checking out [Colorleap](https://colorleap.app/time/1960), a neat web application showcasing different color across the ages, spanning from 2000bc close to modern time.

One of the neat choices found on this website relates to the different colors. They are sorted either vertically, in a card, or horizontally, on their own, but still in rounded boxes. As you hover on a particular color, this one expands to cover twice, perhaps 1.5 its original size.

I through it was rather neat, and chose to see how hard it would be to replicate such a design with a few CSS properties.
