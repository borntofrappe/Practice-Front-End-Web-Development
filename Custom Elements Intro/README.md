# Custom Elements

<!-- Working project live [right here]() on codepen. -->

## Preface

Inspired by the redesign @css, and the peculiar `circle-text` element seen at a certain viewport size, I set out to re create the circular pattern.

In the process, I got to learn about a new SVG element wrapped in the `<text>` tag name, namely `<textPath>`, and I was introduced to custom HTML elements, a first ingredient to _Web Components_.
