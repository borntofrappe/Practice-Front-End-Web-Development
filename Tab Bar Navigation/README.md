Hitting tab [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/qwqPwq).

## Preface

Another project for the #weeklycodingchallenge. After an entertaining [sign in & sign up form](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/OGyJbm) and a [full page slider](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/wZzrdX), the goal is to replicate [this particular design](https://dribbble.com/shots/5925052-Google-Bottom-Bar-Navigation-Pattern) for a mobile, or close to mobile, navigation.

## Notes

Teaching project for the following subjects:

- SVG syntax, specifically commands for the path element;

- CSS custom properties, scoped to the anchor links and updated with JavaScript;

- CSS transitions, selectively applied only when a class is added.
