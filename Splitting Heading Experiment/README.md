# Splitting Heading

Semi-proud working pen available [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/aMxOWV).

## Preface

A project which is both elementary, in terms of the JavaScript logic required in the script, and incredibly time consuming, in terms of fabricating the glyphs making up the alphabeth.

Simply put: type in the input element to have the heading display SVG elements matching the letters.
