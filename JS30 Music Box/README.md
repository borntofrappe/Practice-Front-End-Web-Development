# JavaScript 30 Music Box

Proud result live, [right here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/WPmdmJ).

## Preface

[The video](https://youtu.be/VuN8qwZoego) is actually about a drum machine, but since I developed one instance of a drum machine before, I decided to pick another musical instrument.

Inspired by a design on dribble, I decided to create a basic interface for a basic piano.

## Update

The design turned out to be rather nice. I added a bit of interactivity in the form of key presses, but it is definitely a minor addition in the grand scheme of things.

The project lacks its most prominent feat, playing audio when using one of the keys, but for the first day of practice I wanted to entertain mainly the design of the application.

## Second Update

While researching possible ways of including audio, I stumbled upon the Web Audio API. It is all still new to me, and I haven't ironed out all the details when it comes to play audio and handle different, often overlapping events, but it is a good start and honestly something I dind't anticipated I would be able to achieve.
