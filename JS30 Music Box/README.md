# JavaScript 30 Music Box

Work-in-progress [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/WPmdmJ).

## Preface

[The video](https://youtu.be/VuN8qwZoego) is actually about a drum machine, but since I developed one instance of a drum machine before, I decided to pick another musical instrument.

Inspired by a design on dribble, I decided to create a basic interface for a basic piano.

## Update

The design turned out to be rather nice. I added a bit of interactivity in the form of key presses, but it is definitely a minor addition in the grand scheme of things.

The project lacks its most prominent feat, playing audio when using one of the keys, but for the first day of practice I wanted to entertain mainly the design of the application.
