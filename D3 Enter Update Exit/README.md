## Preface

The title describe the projec rather well. Just a couple of notes on the visualization:

- there's still something to learn about the described pattern, especially when appending multiple elements and binding data points;

- fetching data from the F1 API works fine locally, but not on Codepen. This forced a bit of a re-write on the platform, but this minor annoyance is quite the price to pay for an unsecure HTTP source.
