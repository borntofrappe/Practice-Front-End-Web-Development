# Preface 

The purpose of this project is simply to implement in a real project, first hand, knowledge accrued with regards to regular expressions.

# Plan

- [x] create a signup form, with label and input elements for username, email and password
- [x] with stylus have fun specifying variables for custom colors, even overriding default values
- [x] in a JS script, use regular expression and the .test() function to attach a class of valid when the input for the username meets a certain condition
- [x] implement the same logic on all input elements
- [x] figure out how to apply the regex logic to all input elements without repeating too much code.

# Lessons learned

Include lessons learned regarding regex and the plethora of information available in the event triggered on an element.
