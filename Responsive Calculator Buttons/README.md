# Preface 

The purpose of this project is to create a grid with several buttons of the same size. Responsive buttons which change on press. Buttons with depth as to make them seemingly 3D.

This is a component for a larger project, namely the advanced project "Build a JavaScript Calculator" for the Front-end Certificate @freecodecamp

# Plan

- [x] display nine buttons in a 3 by 3 grid
- [x] give each button a data attribute for the respective value of each element
- [x] include a display on top of the grid
- [x] position the entire structure in the center of the page
- [x] listen for a click event on each button
- [x] include the value of each button in the display when the button is clicked
