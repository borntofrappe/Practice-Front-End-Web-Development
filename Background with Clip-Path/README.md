# Preface 

The purpose of this project is to learn about and put into practice the CSS property of `clip-path`. I have last seen this property as applied on [Unique.prototype.io](https://unique.prototypo.io/) to create a nice looking background, but elsewhere I have seen it applied to create good-looking borders for images and otherwise HTML element.

Specifically, this project is tasked to create the nice-looking background just referenced. 

# Plan

- [x] create a simple layout which stretches beyond the entire available viewport height; this as to create enough space to allocate the desired background;
- [x] apply a background of a solid color or slightly changing gradient and have it span the different HTML element (with a box-y, rectangle structure);
- [x] study how the clip-path property can be included to cut portions of the background out of view.
