# Canvas Experiment

<!-- Link to the work-in-progress pen right [here](). -->

## Preface

I was considering tinkering with the canvas element. Mostly for my own personal website, as I wanted to create a final section just to learn the visitor express him or herself.

Luckily for me, the [mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) are quite thorough on this topic.

And with a bit of tinkering and experimentation, I ended up creating something quite amusing.
