## Preface

I was considering tinkering with the canvas element. Mostly for my own personal website, as I wanted to create a final section just to learn the visitor express him or herself.

Luckily for me, the [mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) are quite thorough on this topic.

And with a bit of tinkering and experimentation, I ended up creating something quite amusing. It is still something that might not be perfectly suited for production, but it is a good starting point with the `canvas` element.
