# D3 Hierarchy Practice

<!-- Link to the work-in-progress pen right [here](). -->

## Preface

[Yesterday's visualization](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/RezNOz) could use some improvements. And I can also benefit from some additional practice.

Improvements:

- add a legend atop the visualization, displaying the categories with small rectangle elements, of the color later used in the viualization;

- recreate the hierarchical visualization, but with a _circular packing_ layout.
