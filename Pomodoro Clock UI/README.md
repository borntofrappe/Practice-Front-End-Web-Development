# Preface

This project sets out to create the UI for a pomodoro clock application. It is actually the first step toward completing the penultimate project which allows me to earn the 'Front End Libraries' certification @freeCodeCamp.

The focus of that project is the creation a functioning application, which allows users to start working and break sessions one after the other. That being said, I wanted to spend some time on the design of the app itself.

Unlike my [previous effort]() with this type of application, the UI of this project makes use of `grid` properties. I wanted to experiment with grid-based layout and position the different elements of the application according to the space allowed by the viewport. Both in terms of width and height. 

[Layout Land](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag/videos) has been quite helpful in this regard, inspiring me to try out new things and questioning the normal flow of a website.
