# CPC POP

Proud, and working, project live on codepen, [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/MLyybo).

## Preface

Originally, I started this project to simply create an entry for the weekly #codepenchallenge, themed around the following colors:

- #000;

- #fff;

- #FF1EAD.

Basically black and white, with a pink accent. I wanted to toy around with the idea of pink balloons, floating and bursting at a click's notice, and I figured it could fit well with the topic of the last video in the #javascript30 course.

Armed with this perspective, I upped the ante, so to speak, and created a rather simple, but nonetheless teaching game. Teaching in the way I got to practice with CSS animation and transitions, in the way I merge these concepts within the JavaScript script.

One of the highlights of the week, to be sure.
