# Preface

This project is a bite-size project tasked to create a component of a larger project. In particular, a component of a portfolio page. More specifically, a navigation bar for a portfolio page.

I wanted the navigation bar to be learn and easy on the eyes, but above all I required the navbar to be primed for mobile devices. To resolve this self-imposed requirement, the navbar changes in appearance depenging on the size of the viewport.

On large screens, the navigation bar shows a logo and all the anchor link element it contains.

On small screens, it shows just the logo and a button. Button which is used to toggle the appearance of the anchor links elements, shown in a separate panel which is introduced from the right edge of the screen.
