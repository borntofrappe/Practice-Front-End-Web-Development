# React Tutorial Tic Tac Toe

## Preface

I'm planning to dedicate several of the coming days to React, to sharpen my accrued skills, improve lackluster areas and learn best practices. No better place to start than the official docs. No better route than the hands-on approach of building a simple application.

The tutorial is available [right here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). I plan to focus on substance first, developing the application while jotting down notes on the subject, and style the application at a later stage.

Turned out to be quite the teaching experience. I was mostly intrigued by the time-traveling feature and it did not disappoint.
