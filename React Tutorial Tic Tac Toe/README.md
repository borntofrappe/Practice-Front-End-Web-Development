# React Tutorial Tic Tac Toe

<!-- Link to the working pen right [here] -->

## Preface

With this project I plan to start my deep dive in React-land. I plan to go through several sources in the coming days to practice and improve my skills with the framework. I thought of no better place to start than the official documentation.

With this effort I therefore choose to follow the tutorial as available [right here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and build a tic-tac-toe game.
