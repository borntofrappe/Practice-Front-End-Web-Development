# RSS Feed Fetching

<!-- Link to the proud (and live!) pen [right here]() -->

## Preface

Following up with the UX slash UI created for the freeCodeCamp podcast application, I use the coding session to retrieving information from the RSS feed ultimately used in the larger project.

The feed in question:

```js
http://podcast.freecodecamp.org/rss
```

Good chance to flex with a couple of JavaScript methods and a new friend in `DOMParser`. I am still unsure as to target the `itunes` elements, outside of regular expressions, so while much is acquired, still much is left to discovery.
