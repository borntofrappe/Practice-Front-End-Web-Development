## Preface

[Yesterday's effort](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/zMWpEx) was rather mediocre. I decided to update the UI detailing the functionality of the entire application. It'll soon work on the back-end as well, but currently it function (and much more efficiently than before) on the front-end only.
