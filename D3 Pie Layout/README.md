## Preface

With this project I plan to experiment with D3 layouts. This to continue the theme of the overall week and practice a little bit more with the library, before plunging into the challenges @freeCodeCamp.

Specifically, I'd like to tinker with a pie chart and a stack chart, each with their own set of data.

The data is to be introduced before each visualization, in a table element.
