# JavaScript Clock

## Preface

I already have a couple projects rather related to [this episode of javascript30](https://youtu.be/xu87YWbr4X0):

- [an animated clock powered by React and SVG](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/ebRVJd). Honestly one of my proudest projects.

- [a minimalistic React and SVG clock](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/wXGKpg). Honestly a project I almost forgot.

- a couple of projects creating a pomodoro clock. Projects that, while not really encompassing a clock face, they do use a date object and update the UI of the application according to it changing. [One using vanilla JS](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/PeKwOW), [one using React](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/bjvmaJ/).

I decided to nevertheless go through the work of creating a new clock, a new analog watch inspired by the video. It has certainly allowed me to implement a few methods I learned in the past few months.

Notable mention to `Object.entries`, allowing me to concisely update the clock's hands all in one go.

Allowing me also to update the UI and specifically the colors being used in the project, at the click of a button.
