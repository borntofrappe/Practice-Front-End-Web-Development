# Introduction

The purpose of this particular project is the creation of a clock, with React.js and SVG syntax.

While reading React's [own documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) I came upon the implementation of a clock, through a function which updates the state of a component every second. I thought it would be a good excuse to practice with React's core concepts, such as state, lifecycle methods, class components, and also to practice with SVG syntax, with arcs commands.

React handles the functionality of the clock, SVG allows for a small twist on the normal clock design, with "crazy-straw"-like clock hands.
