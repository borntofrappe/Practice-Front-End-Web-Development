## Preface

With this project, I plan to make use of yet another layout function provided by D3.js, in order to build a **stack layout**. 

I plan to start from a previous project, relating to a [column chart](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/YjdVLM) I previously drew to practice with SVG syntax, ordinal scales and transition methods.

I plan to also re-design the project to provide a more enticing appearance.
