## Preface

Following [yesterday's project](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/wYOONv) I decided to catch up with a video by [Web Bos on the canvas element](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZGAzJ0drl0). I was quite humbled, and honestly felt quite foolish for my own interpretation. The approach was incredibly appealing and much an improvement on my own take, so I decided to consider its logic and expand my previous effort ever so slightly.

Considering all things, I believe this application fulfills what I wanted to create for my own website.
