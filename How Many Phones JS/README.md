### Preface

The purpose of the project is to merge recent advances in JS, made while reading [You don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), with other front-end development concepts. 
This intent is manifested in a pen in which to implement the simple algorithm manufactured out of Chapter 1 of the first book [Up & Going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going).
