# Preface 

Today I celebrated a small win, and it brought incredible satisfaction. Truth be told, I've been in a bit of a slump caused by D3.js and its complexity, and the small achievement seriously picked me up.

So, I decided to start this small project, for fun, practice, and actual necessity. 

I've been wanting to create a small logo based on my twitter handle for quite some time. I wanted to craft a simple logo, built with SVG and animated without much complexity. This to practice with the underlying syntax, and also because I was missing any SVG editing software.

In the text editor, I tinkered with SVG syntax, `text`, `path`, `line` elements, and created a simple pen. Celebrating a small victory with a small victory.

And as far as D3 is concerned, I picked up a book to help me dive in the topic. Progress made of small wins, once more.
