# Preface 

For the weekly [#codepenchallenge](https://codepen.io/challenges/2018/june/) I took inspiration from several sources:

- [this dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2973869-Stories) inspired me to position the image right at the top of the page, with a gradient transitioning the reader's eye from the image to the actual text of the page. As I am not particularly fond of big, hero images, the flower's image is set to occupy less than 100% of the viewport height;

- [this article](https://24ways.org/2016/css-writing-modes/) inspired me to toy around with vertical writing modes. For particularly large screen devices, I thought it'd be a neat addition to have some additional text right next to the main content;

- [this insightful article](https://css-tricks.com/your-brain-on-front-end-development/) was an inspiration in general.

As the challenge is mostly CSS related, any additional content I thought about adding can be added through pseudo-elements. 

For the font themselves, I went with _Muli_ for paragraphs and _Montserrat Alternate_ for the headers. 

The project turned out to be a great way to refresh CSS selectors.
