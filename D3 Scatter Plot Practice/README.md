## Preface

With this project I plan to practice with a few concept picked up while reading the documentation on [d3 github page](https://github.com/d3).

This to create a _scatter plot_ displaying raw data with circle elements and the distribution across the axes through histograms, plotted at the top and to the right of the scatter plot itself.
