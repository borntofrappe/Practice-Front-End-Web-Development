## Preface

For [another installment](https://youtu.be/LAaf7-WuJJQ) of the #javascript30 course, I set out to create a countdown timer, allowing visitors to set a certain number of minutes and have the application relate the passage of time.

In the end, a really teaching episode which perhaps got me to spend too much time on the design of the application itself.
