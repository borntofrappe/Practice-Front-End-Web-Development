## Preface

This project was inspired by [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). In detail, it was meant to replicate the dotted line connecting the different stages of the Gatsby flow (data sources, build, deploy). More in general, it ended being a good excuse to use a few CSS layout properties and eventually offered a good practice session.
