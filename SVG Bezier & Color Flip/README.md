## Preface

After a day spent learning about back-end Node.js, I didn't plan to actually open up my text editor on a new front-end project. After checking [Design Systems in Figma](https://designcode.io/design-system-in-figma/) however, I decided to flex my brain trying to replicate the incredibly soothing SVG animation which sees a vector line morph up and down, as a wave.

I was also intrigued by the light/dark theme of the application, but that is something to consider only at a later stage.
