  include a single SVG which is used for both the frame and the text
  in the final version, buttons allowing to get a new quote and share the quote on twitter will be added, either next to or at the bottom of the frame
-->

  <!--
  in the wrapping SVG, include a viewbox equal to 1000+20 and 720+20
  this to later move the contents of the SVG in the frame and avoid cropping, while having nice round coordinates for the circle and path elements (1000*700)
  inspired by the way D3.js works with axes 
  -->

    <!-- 
      include a pattern which gives the impression of a texture, by including small circles side by side 
      reduce the opacity to avoid an excessive overlay

      - move the contents 10 to the right and 10 to the bottom, allowing the contents to work on a 1000*700 frame, while at the same time avoiding cropping at the edges
      - set stroke and fill properties shared by all SVG elements (stroke width is different for the circle elements and the frame, fill is actually altered for the path element as to include the texture)

      <!-- include a text element for the quote 
      stroke to give weight to the characters

      for the chosen frame and font-size (4.5rem), approximately 25 characters can stay on a single line
      in JS, when including a real quote dynamically, include tspan elements when this length is exceeded 
      tspan with a dy element pushing each successive tspan by 100, to avoid overlaps and distance the lines (4 lines seems to be an upper threshold, something which can be tested in JS)
      
      with text anchor set to middle, even if the text varies in length it gets still displayed centered in the frame
