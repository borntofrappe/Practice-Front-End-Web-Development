# Preface

This project was inspired by the following [design concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/3705845-Yala-Quote-Contest-Win-all-kinds-of-rad-stuffs). 

In earnest, the project is also scheduled to be a part of a larger endeavor, for the @freeCodeCamp curriculum and specifically the "Front End Libraries" certification. It should come to no surprise, if you managed to see the working pen, that the actual project is the **Random quote machine**. I have previously and successfully built such an application [before](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/VQYmpJ), but managed the effort without any front-end library. To earn the certification with flying colors, I therefore decided to re-tool my efforts with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). In trying to include novelty on the design aspect as well, I looked for inspiration and found it, among many other sources, in the referenced link.

The cited design is also a reminder of a [CSS Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/scooped-corners-in-2018/). While I managed to read the article the time it came out, I wanted to design my own solution, so I did not take this source as a tutorial. It was definitely a push thought, which is why I decided to reference it.

I thought at first on how to achieve the nice corners with HTML and CSS only, but in the end I figured SVG would be the most resilient and practical tool for the job. This allows me to not only practice once more with SVG and its syntax, but also tweak the appearance of the frame to perhaps include a texture, to promote even more the old-timey retro look of the frame. SVG filters, or SVG patterns, seem to be two candidate for this job. I might have some research to do on both to pick the right tool.
