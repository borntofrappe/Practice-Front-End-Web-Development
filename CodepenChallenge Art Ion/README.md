## Preface

It started as a simple project to emulate the nice effect included in the _decodeurs_ section of the French newspaper lemonde. For reference, the effect is visible [right here](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/) in the words _decodeurs_, _vrai_, _faux_ and a few others.

In the end, it developed in quite the small yet pleasing to the eye experiment with a few CSS properties and a few lines of JavaScript code.
