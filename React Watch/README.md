# React Watch

Semi-proud work-in-progress pen [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ebRVJd).

## Preface

I found myself staring at the clock application on my mobile, mesmerized by the design na dits simple animation. After thinking a while how to re-create the application on the web, I decided to try out my luck with React and styled-components.

## Update

I decided to steer the project toward SVG instead of styled-components. While I push development forward, I will drop the styling library and focus on scalable vector graphic syntax.

## Priorities

- fix the issue with sizes. As it stands, the way the SVG and its inner elements are sized is horrendous and absolutely not scalable.

- comment the codebase. Perhaps and actually before the first issue, this problem is at the root of my annoyances with the project. There's no clear picture as to what each component does. Start by documenting and move forward one step at a time. Which components ought to be displayed. What input do they need.

- add the visual for the seconds. This should not leverage a hand, but another nifty solution.

- start animating the clock.

Throw away most of the priorities I described right now and focus on point two. Everything else will follow.
