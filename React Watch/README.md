# React Watch

Semi-proud work-in-progress pen [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ebRVJd).

## Preface

I found myself staring at the clock application on my mobile, mesmerized by the design na dits simple animation. After thinking a while how to re-create the application on the web, I decided to try out my luck with React and styled-components.

## Update

I decided to steer the project toward SVG instead of styled-components. While I push development forward, I will drop the styling library and focus on scalable vector graphic syntax.
