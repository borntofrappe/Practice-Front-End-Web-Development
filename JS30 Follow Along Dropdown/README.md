# Follow Along Dropdown

<!-- Proud result live [right here on codepen]() -->

## Preface

Continuing the #javascript30 course, and particularly continuing from the project titled 'follow along links' which you can find [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/qLwMrX), I set out to replicate the intriguing navigation provided on the Stripe website.

## Update 1am

I really wasn't planning on continuing with the first rough version, but live on codepen, and after publicly stating my daily efforts, I got caught up in the heat of the moment. The end result: barring a few missing steps, the project is basically done. As you hover on anchor link elements, there the dropdown background appears, resizes and repositions itself.

Still need to figure out how to remove the background as the cursor hovers away from the anchor link. It all boils down to the events being fired on the list items / anchor link elements.
