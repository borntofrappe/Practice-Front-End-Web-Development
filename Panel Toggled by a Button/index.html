      <h1>What is This?</h1>
      <p>Mostly just an excuse to practice with HTML, CSS and a couple lines of JS, to create a panel which is toggled into and out of sight.</p>
      <h2>Isn't this nice?</h2>
      <p>Lorem ipsum text would have definitely been much more efficient.</p>
      <h2>But while you are here</h2>
      <p>Hope you noticed the animation for the text as well, I'm starting to consider the 12 principles of animation.</p>
      <p>This <a href="https://vimeo.com/250349313" title="Talk on Web Animation" target="_blank">talk</a> may enlighten you on the topic.</p>
