# Preface 

The purpose of this small pen is the re-creation of a modal as seen on [Daily CSS](https://dailycssdesign.com/144/). The page has a very entertaining button, at the bottom center of the page, which allows to toggle a modal, a dialogue window with information pertaining the page itself.

A very neat way to display additional information, if need be.

# Plan

- [x] create a page with a button in the bottom center of the screen
- [x] on hover, transition the border around the button
- [x] when active, add a semi-translucent background to the button
- [x] every time the button is clicked, it should toggle a div
- [x] the div ought to be located in the bottom center of the page without height, when hidden
- [x] the div ought to spread itself over the available height and most of all width, when shown
