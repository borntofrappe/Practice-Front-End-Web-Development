# D3 Chord Practice

<!-- Link to the work-in-progress pen right [here](). -->

## Preface

Following up on yesterday's project, I set out to create a chord layout. This time with actual data, this time showing different values according to the selected year.

The data is drawn from the [EuroStat database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/international-trade-in-goods/data/database#), and relates to the export quantity, in thousands of euros from country to country.

The selected countries are those making up the initial european community:

- Belgium;

- France;

- Germany;

- Italy;

- Luxembourg;

- Netherlands.

For these six and for the 2014, 2015, 2016 years.
