## Preface

This project was inspired by a three-part article on Dev.to. You can find the first part [right here](https://dev.to/agathacco/how-to-create-pure-css-illustrations-and-animate-them---part-1-1j1k).

In full, I was inspired by said article, plenty of pens leveraging CSS to draw something incredibly neat and Crash Team Racing. This last one was responsible for the actual subject of the drawing: the first to the throttle, last to the brakes [Polar](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OXdSbNPWto4/hqdefault.jpg).

I thought it be nice to:

- draw the polar bear as closely as possible;

- draw the two crates as well;

- include a blue background, perhaps with a gradient allowing to a emulate reflecting surface, in the bottom section where the bear would lie. On second thought, a single-hue background might be a better fit for the simplicity of the drawing.

One thing at a time though.
