A couple of SVG for Sarah Drasner. Live [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/rRzMwr).

## Preface

For the #codepenchallenge in the first week of March, as proposed [right here](https://codepen.io/challenges/2019/march/1), the topic is **coding heroes**. I decided for the occasion to celebrate Sarah Drasner, for all the inspiration she has given me with her hard work and incredible proficiency.

I decided to use SVG elements, which are more than fitting considering the expert that Sarah is in the vector-graphic field, and to animate path elements through the `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties.
