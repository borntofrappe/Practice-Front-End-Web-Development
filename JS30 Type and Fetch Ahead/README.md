# Type and Fetch Ahead

<!-- Proud result live [right here on codepen](). -->

## Preface

Very short preface for a project with one single purpose: display information matching the text in an `input` element. Information retrieved through the `fetch` method.

Inspired by the #javascript30 course, and [this video](https://youtu.be/y4gZMJKAeWs) in particular.

Allowing me to practice with a few JavaScript methods, such as:

- `array.filter`

- `array.map`

- `array.slice`

- `string.indexOf`.

Allowing me to craft a silly function including spaces as decimal separators.

Allowing me to flex with SVG elements (completely coded by hand, without assitance from Inkscape) and the `preserveAspectRatio` attribute. In this regard, more research is needed in how SVG elements are scaled (I don't pretend to understand the nuances of this attribute).
