# Preface 

The purpose of this project is to partake in the weekly challlenge proposed by Codepen with regards to web development concepts regarding a selected theme.

In line with the theme of retro video-games, the proposed topic of the week is *Paperboy*, which apparently is a NES game out of the eighties. Honestly, the game has always evaded by knowledge, but that won't stop me from creating a front-end concept with the video-game in mind.

The idea, prompted by a quick look to the game, is to create a old-timey-look newspaper, resembling the starting menu in the game. 

This newspaper is to be created with `grid` properties, to allow for different design with different screen sizes. Perhaps this breaks the one-solution design with which the newspaper was designed, but I see it as a visual upgrade to the subject matter.

In addition to the grid properties affecting the layout of the newspaper and its presentation across devices, additional properties are to be included as to animate the newspaper as a whole.

The silly idea I have in mind is to have the newspaper rotate from its center with an animation which screams *Extra extra, read ll'bout it!*

# Plan

- [x] sit down and design the layout of the newspaper. Even if just on a piece of paper.
- [x] following this rough visualization, create the layout which achieves the desired output, one grid container at a time
- [x] include the text for the header of the newspaper, the headers of the articles and the text of the different the articles. 
- [x] revise the color palette and the font used on the page to give a retro yet modern look, which sorts-of resembles the old design
- [x] include appropriate tags for the weekly challenge, push code on github, share effort on twitter

The plan is rather ambitious, but it represents an effort which is scheduled to occur over a couple or three nights of laid-back programming.

Truly, enough said. Comments in the HTML and CSS files describe the most important steps of the project already.
