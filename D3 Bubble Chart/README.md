## Preface

With this project I plan to practice a tad more with the Data Driven library, as to create a bubble plot. Technically, a bubble chart is not that much different from a scatter plot. You include circles for each data point, in a two dimensional panel.

The only noticeable difference is the inclusion of a third dimension, in the radius of the circle.

_Small note_

As real data is not readily available, I will use data in the form of random integers.
