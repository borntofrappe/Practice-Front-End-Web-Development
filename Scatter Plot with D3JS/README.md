# Preface 

The purpose of this project is to once again use the D3.js library to this time create a scatterplot for the monthy weather averages in Paris. In so doing, I get to experiment with the library, scale and axis functions.

# Plan
- [x] retrieve data regarding monthly averages, for maximum and minimum temperatures
- [x] drawn an svg element on the page 
- [x] include a dot for each data point in the SVG. Data points should be displayed "in pairs", with two dots matching in horizontal coordinate for the month to which they relate
- [x] include axis 
- [x include a scale function as to allow for the graph to scale at will 
- [x] think of some ways in which to enhance the presentation, with text and title and perhaps additional elements and with transitions on hover.
