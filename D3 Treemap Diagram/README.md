## Preface

With this project I plan to celebrate the completion of another round of the 100daysofcode challenge. This while creating a treemap diagram showcasing the different projects entertained through the three months plus ten days period.

I've lucky enough to practice with a lot of projects, mostly on the front-end, mostly regarding CSS and JavaScript. As of late, I've begun working with Node.js as well, but it is just the beginning with that respect. I've also been lucky enough to collect three FreeCodeCamp certifications, displayed separately as to signal their importance.

The data used for the treemap diagram can be found in the `data.json` file.
