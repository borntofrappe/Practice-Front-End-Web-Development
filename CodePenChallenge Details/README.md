# Preface

The purpose of this project is to participate in the weekly [codepen challenge](https://codepen.io/challenges/2018/may/), with an entry centered around the HTML elements of `<details>` and `<summary>`.

While researching the topic, I immediately appreciated the ease with which the two elements allow to create an FAQ structure, in which questions provide a detailed answer, if need be.

Indeed by storing the question in the summary element and the answer in the rest of the details element, a neat "folded" structure is already available. Upon clicking on the question, it is then possible to access the nested answer. Provided the browser supports the details and summary tags.

Building upon this preface, the simple project is tasked to replicate the structure of a quiz, in which a question with four possible answers is created with the mentioned elements.

With JavaScript and few CSS classes it is also possible to make the project responsive and interactive. Upon chosing an answer, it is indeed possible to visually confirm the right choice, keep track of the number of correct answers and finally display the outcome of the short quiz.

## Planning

While coming up with an idea for the project at hand, I included a few steps to be followed in the development of the application. Soon enough I stopped bothering about this planned steps and instead poured myself into the code editor, chasing what is finally become the project visible in the live pen.

Guess it is a lecture in the importance of planning, even if just to kick-start the flow of development.
