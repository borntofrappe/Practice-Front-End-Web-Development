  <title>Ruled Paper Animation</title>
  <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this project is to experiment once more with CSS animations and CSS variables. The goal is to position some text upon ruled paper, which is animated out of sight at the click of a button.">

<!--
container for the cells making up the ruled paper structure
the actual number of cells is exaggerrated to cover most screen sizes

a better solution would be to consider the width and height of the viewport, through JS
and append only as many cells as needed to cover the entire visible area (possible upgrade)
