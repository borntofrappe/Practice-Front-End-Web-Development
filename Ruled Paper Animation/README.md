## Preface

The purpose of this project is to experiment once more with CSS animations and CSS variables. Once more, taking inspiration from [Coda.io](https://coda.io/welcome).

In particular, this project sets out to accomplish the animation visible below the green-ish section with glowing icons, achieved in a previous [attempt](). As the visitor scrolls to this section, he/she can see ruled paper with some text overlaid on it. As the visitor scrolls further, the cells making up the lines of the ruled paper fall to display a nice orange background, leading up to a nice bold logo.

For the simple project, the goal is to present the same ruled paper and animate the cells in a similar way, but to present instead some text right behind it.

The effect on the referenced page is triggered by a scroll event, but for the project at hand a simple button is included to toggle between end states.

Click a button, the page is animated making all cells and the first text elments fall down and disappear. Click another button, the page is brought back to its original state.

> Okay?
