# Preface 

The purpose of this project is to replicate an incredibly neat-looking design choice as seen on [Status.im](https://status.im/). The site presents two incredibly good-looking radial-gradients, one of which is even animated to show a rippling halo emerge out of a specified location.

It is truly a joyful design. 

# Plan

- [x] create a first card with a radial gradient centered in the bottom center of the card itself, to practice with the syntax of linear gradients
- [x] create a second card in which the radial gradient is complemented with an icon or otherwise graphical assets from which a rippling animation emerges (a radio tower immediately comes to mind, as something which is not overly complicated to pull off with SVG)


# Notes

// TODO add notes on multiple backgrounds and repeating gradients
