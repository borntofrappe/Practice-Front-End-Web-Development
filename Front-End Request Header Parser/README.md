# Front End Request Header Parser

<!-- Link to the working pen right [here]() -->

## Preface

With this project I plan to create the insightful homepage of ultimately a **request header parser** microservice.

Tht mentioned application is the second of five project to earn the **Microservices and API** certification @freeCodeCamp. Necessarily, it will include the spouted functionality through a simple **node** and **express** application.
