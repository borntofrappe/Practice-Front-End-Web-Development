## Preface

With this project I set out to create an entry for the weekly #codepenchallenge. As luck would have it, the topic of the week is to teach a design concept, and it is the perfect pretext to finally struggle and create a long-awaited design pattern. A carousel. I never actually pondered how to create such a feat, and through CSS grid I think I might be able to create a neat solution.
