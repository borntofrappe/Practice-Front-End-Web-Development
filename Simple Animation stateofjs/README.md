# Simple Animation: stateofjs

<!-- Link to the work-in-progress pen right [here](). -->

## Preface

I wanted to recreate the animation found on the [homepage](https://2018.stateofjs.com) of the latest survey on the state of JavaScript.

Turns out, the effect is much more easily achievable with D3 and a force simulation. It is a function I used only once before, so it might be useful to practice with the method.

At later date that is. For the time being, I am contented enough by animating a grid of 11 items with CSS properties and JavaScript.
