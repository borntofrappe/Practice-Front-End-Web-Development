# Konami Code

## Preface

Perhaps this project is better labeled as _typing adventure_, given the eventual result, but I decided to stick with the title of [the video](https://youtu.be/_A5eVOIqGLU) which inspired it all.

Continuing the JavaScript 30 course, this project allows me to practice with sequence detection, but at the end of the day also with CSS animation and the interplay between CSS keyframe animations and JavaScript logic.

I am particularly glad to see the animation of the `<h2>` element, which allows to highlight the text whenever it is injected, and for a brief period.
