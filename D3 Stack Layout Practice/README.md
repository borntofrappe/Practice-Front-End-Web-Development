# D3 Practice

<!-- Link to the work-in-progress pen right [here](). -->

## Preface

After a week dedicated to React and back-end Node practice, I plan to use this project as to once again continue my efforts with the D3.js.

I am considering a few articles on the library itself, but for the time being, I am concerned with two essential pain points:

- how to showcase data in different visualization;

- how different visualizations convey different meaning.

With regards to this last point, I have indubitably disregarded the implication of previous layouts. This in favour of actually learning how to use the library. I maintain this was essential to understand practically the library's methods and how SVG elements can be used to display data in different formats. Once such core aspects are understood, it is however helpful to go one step further and ask a few essential questions: is this the best visualization to display this set of data? Is this the best way to convey a message?

This particular project sets out to compensate such lacking consideration, trying to tackle both bullet points. It sets out to replicate a few visualizations inspired by [this article @lemondefr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2018/10/04/mondial-de-l-auto-a-quoi-ressemble-la-voiture-des-francais_5364796_4355770.html), while adding other visualizations to perhaps highlight different facets, different implications behind the data. The data, most importantly, is referenced in each visualization provided by the article itself and I stress here the importance of having the same care. It is essential in providing a robust visualization which can be checked and even replicated by other developers.

## Stacked Charts

The first three visualizations concern stacked area charts. While they do provide an intriguing overview of the general trend, they are also difficult to read. This is where other visualizations, perhaps supporting visualizations might help.

- [ ] re-create the visualization(s);

- [ ] detail the individual "stacks" side by side, each in their own visualization.
