# JS30 Position Sticky

Project live [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ZwXeWY).

## Preface

For the project regarding a navigation bar made to stick at the top of the page, in the javascript30 course and as available [right here](https://youtu.be/5FLOBCGH3_U), I took inspiration of the sticky positioning to create a series of sticky labels.

It's mostly about CSS and the property of `position:sticky`, but it does use JavaScript, in so far as JS is used to create the markup, apply a solid color and most importantly position each label at a fraction of the viewport. At a fraction and spanning a fraction of the viewport.

I'll pencil this project under the curious ones.
