# Exercise Tracker UI

<!-- Link to the working pen right here -->

## Preface

With this project I set out to create the front-end portion of what will eventually become a full-stack application for a @freeCodeCamp project.

The project in question is the fourth project in the line of **API and Microservices** certification, and relates to an **exercise tracker**.

From what can be discerned from the [example project](https://fuschia-custard.glitch.me/), the application needs to provide the following features:

- there exist a form which allows to create a new user;

- there exist a form which allows, for a specific user, to add an exercise. This detailing a very brief description of the exercise, the duration in minutes and the date following the (yyyy-mm-dd) format.

Concerning the back-end of the application, the application ought to also display a list of exercises "committed" by the specific user, but that goes beyond the scope of the simple UI. The UI indeed relates exclusively to the homepage, to the root path. Any other request returns a JSON object.
