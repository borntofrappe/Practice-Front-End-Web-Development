# Local Storage Practice

## Preface

Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL1F4dCUlLc&index=15&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP6CGK4YVJhL_VWetA865GOH), but mostly to learn how to save bits of text in local storage, I set out to create a simple todo application with vanilla JS. With durable state, so to speak.

It started rather small, with a simple list and adding to local storage an array of strings. In the end, I toyed with a few concepts from the video itself to create a simple, yet effective way to list one's activities and update on their statuses by toggling a red, orange, green light on them. Really helpful practice with JavaScript.
