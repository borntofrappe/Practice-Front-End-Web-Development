## Preface

With this rather challenging project I started coding with quite little planning. The following notes are appended on the working project. A project which entailed a lot of practice and a few lessons learned in React-land:

- React components and lifecycle methods;

- React routing;

- Styled components.

All while retrieving data from an external source, and specifically the Pokemon Trading Card game API, and showcasing pokemon cards from the first set.
