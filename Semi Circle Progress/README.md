# Preface 

The purpose of this project is to create a simple HTML + CSS solution, while leveraging two additional tools in my workflow: Git and Stylus. They have different purposes, but they are incorporated into a single project in order to be efficient.

For the project itself, the goal is to create a progress bar which is actually represented by the outline of a semi-circle instead of a straight line. Inspired by [Artboard.studio](https://artboard.studio).

# Plan

- [x] create the outline of a semi circle
- [x] figure out which values are to be modified as to move 
- [x] animate progress changing these values.

Bonus points: animate progress with a range input, which visitors can manouver left and right to change the displayed progress.


# Lessons Learned

// TODO: include lessons learned with Git and stylus
