# JavaScript Practice Sort Band Names

Proud result live [right here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/exyEBo).

## Preface

[This video](https://youtu.be/PEEo-2mRQ7A) in the line of #javascript30 video is strictly about JavaScript, and it allows to practice a bit more with `array.sort()`, not to mention with regular expressions.

It wasn't meant to be a standalone project, but I nevertheless wanted to flex a little my skills past the sorting itself. The end result is a rather good looking project, managing a bit of state and highlighting the different stages in which the sorting actually occurs.
