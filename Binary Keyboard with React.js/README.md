# Preface 

Small project to practice with React, specifically with state, functions and controlled input.

The page has a controlled input, with react updating the UI, but not with the keystroke actually selected by the typist.

What would be neat would be the inclusion of a converter, allowing for a translation back to its original text. Something about which to think for a future update.

# Plan

- [x] set up an HTML file with react.js
- [x] include a single input element in a component, in the JS script file
- [x] render the file in the HTML document
- [x] set up the input element as a controlled input, using state and the onChange attribute to display on screen exactly what is typed in the input element
- [x] consider using a textarea element insted 
- [x] modify the onChange function and the result displayed in the render method to display not exactly what is typed in the element itself

# Notes

For ASCII code [this resource](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html) comes in handy.
For React, the following concepts where used in the script.
