# Preface 

The purpose of this project is to practice with the React.js library. In particular, this project is to get acquainted with:
- stateless functional components;
- stateful component and compositions;
- functions in JSX
- creating and updating state

All to create a simple application in which the inside of a 8-ball is clickable and allows to display a random answer to an hypothetical question.
