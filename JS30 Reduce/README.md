# JS30 Reduce

## Preface

The purpose of this practice session is the computation of the toal number of hours, minutes and seconds which can be attributed to a series of video elements. Said video elements are provided thruogh an unordered list, at the following [url](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/blob/master/18%20-%20Adding%20Up%20Times%20with%20Reduce/index-START.html). The precise information is found in the `data-time` attribute of each element, and the computation is achieved by looping through said elements while leveraging the `reduce` function.
