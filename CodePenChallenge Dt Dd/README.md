# Preface 

The purpose of this project is the creation of an accordion-like card, inspired by the card design of [**Primer**](https://www.yourprimer.com/), by Google itself.

This while creating an entry for the weekly #codepenchallenge, practicing with the HTML elements of `<dl>` and `<dd>`.

The referenced website is by itself a treasure-trove for inspiration, but the project is out to replicate a particular screen of the mobile application. In a card, several "leads" are presented in bold, uppercase text and upon clicking on each section, more information is presented by increasing the relative size of the interacting area. I figured this was a well-suited scenario in which to experiment with the HTML elements and at the same time create something potentially usable.
