# CPC Perfect Purple

<!-- Proud result live [right here on codepen]() -->

## Preface

For the last week of the January challenges @codepen, I decided to once again toy around a silly idea. Initially I wanted to create a simple animation around a wine bottle. Eventually I created an application which shows multiple cards, following one another to present to the visitor the following sequence:

- pick a color, a variation of purple;

- have the color related back, visualized through an empty `div` element resembling a glass.

Purple is being defined here rather loosely as any hue in the _hsl_ code ranging between blue (**h**ue 240) and red (**h**ue 360).
