# CPC Perfect Purple

Proud result live [right here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/exWJNR).

## Preface

For the last week of the January challenges @codepen, I decided to once again toy around a silly idea. Initially I wanted to create a simple animation around a wine bottle. Eventually I created an application which shows multiple cards, following one another to present to the visitor the following sequence:

- pick a color, a variation of purple;

- have the color related back, visualized through an empty `div` element resembling a glass.

## Additional Notes

Purple is being defined here rather loosely as any hue in the _hsl_ code ranging between blue (**h**ue 240) and red (**h**ue 360).

The inspiration for the project as a whole is obviously wine tasting, and a menu with a series of options from which to choose.

The final version provides quite a handful of teaching material, especially regarding the interplay between CSS and JS, but I did not arrive at this solution immediately.

For the sake of posterity, the development process was as follows:

- create the markup in the HTML file;

- assess the common elements between all the containers, and the necessities of each different one;

- re-create the same markup logic in the JS script.
