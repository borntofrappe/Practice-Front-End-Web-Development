    include a single container, in which to later append the required elements
    the idea behind the project is to inject one wrapping container for each stage
    - a modal to introduce the project
    - a panel to show the choices from which to select
    - a modal in which to show the actual choice

    each container includes a button leading to the next element
    the first and the third modal are actually designed with the same UI in mind
