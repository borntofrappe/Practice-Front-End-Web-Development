# Preface 

This project is tasked with creating an entry for the weekly #codepenchallenge. The theme of the week: cards. Cards usually designed for blogging web-sites. Cards detailing information regarding a range of possible topics.

The idea is to create a card which displays the title, subtitle and a short description for an imaginary article. Said card should eerily resemble the design of an actual, playing, card.

With this in mind, I wanted to design the slightly rounded rectangle to have an inner section with the described information, surrounded by a color and random number (or sign), in the top left and in the bottom right of the card.

# Version

V1: Design a single card, with a fixed number and suit.

V2: Include the number and suit randomly. (thank you CSS variables)

V3: Include a title/ matching subtitle and matching short description, randomly and along the previous variables.
