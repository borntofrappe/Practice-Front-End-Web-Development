## Preface

With this simple project I set out to practice with **d3 shapes** and in particular, with lines and areas to build a **layered area chart**.

The following links proved to be rather useful:

- [documentation on lines](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#lines);

- [documentation on curves](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#curves).
