# Preface 

With this project I want to practice with SVG filters. SVG filters and CSS properties to create a simple text replicating the design of an old-timey video-game.

The game in question is _Spyro_. In this decades-old title for the first _Playstation_, the player was presented with a neat 3D, rotating text. This to inform the player of several in-game occurrences, which are beyond the scope of the project.

To replicate such a cute design, the page ought to display text with the same appeal. As closely as possible for somebody getting started with SVG filter.

# Plan

- include some text in the center of the page
- look at a sample of the actual in-game text and jot down a few notes
- research SVG filters to achieve a similar look
