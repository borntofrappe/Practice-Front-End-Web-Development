## Preface

Following up the effort initiated in the **UI Podcast App** folder, I decided to develop the application a bit further, with Vanilla JavaScript. This even if the idea was to create a full-fledged React application.

Features:

- play, pause;

- mute/unmute;

- change the speed;

- stop (meaning go back to 00:00:00).

## Update 19-12-2018

Another feature added with regards to the progress bar. It is now possible to change the current time stamp by interacting with the bar atop the play/pause button. Quite the neat, much needed functionality.

Functionality complemented by a tooltip, shown when hovering on the progress bar itself. Inspired by D3.js.
