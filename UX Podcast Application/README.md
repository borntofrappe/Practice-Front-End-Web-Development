# UX Podcast App

Proud result live [right here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/YdGwow).

## Preface

Following up with yesterday's effort, I decided to fork the UI for the podcast application and add a few functionalities:

- mute/unmute the audio;

- change the 'fastness' of the podcast;

- stop (meaning go back to 00:00:00) the episode.

This to lessen the eventual burden I will later endure in react-land.
