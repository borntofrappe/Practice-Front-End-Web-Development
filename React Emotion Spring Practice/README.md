# React Spring Animation

Link to the working pen [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/BvyJmb).

## Small preface

The pen live on codepen had differs from the source code presented in this repository. As a matter of fact, it is quite a step down from the project I created locally. Following some issues importing the library I ended up refactoring my entire code for the _emotion_ library and somehow lost the ability to add a delay in my _spring_ animations. Go figure.

The lessons learned in the development stand valuable though. Outside of codepen, and especially locally, the project is also quite a marvel to look at.

## Preface

With this project I set out to practice with the following libraries. Behind React that is:

- react-spring;

- emotion.

The former for animation, the latter for styling.
