# Preface

For the weekly #codepenchallenge, the topic is **checkboxes**. Specifically, you are given a single HTML element, in an `<input>` of `type="checkbox"`, and you are given the freedom to do pretty much anything which comes to mind.

During the week, I came up with a simple idea to create a small game built around the single `<input>` element. I was able to finally have a solid concept for a simple game, in which the player uses his or her cursor to check the checkbox. I even came up a the silly name for it, _check me if you can_. As luck would have it, the movie was running on a late Thursday night. 

Eventually, coming Saturday and coming a bit of free time, I decided to sit down and implement the idea. While developing, I came up for the details of the game, the general layout with a controls' panel, the SVG icons to showcase the games' very own controls. 

It has been a very teaching experience, which brought me to code quite a lot with vanilla JavaScript. Something which is always good. 

In the 200+ lines of code I got to practice with intervals and overall with different processes, different sequences. Even if simple, indeed the game can follow different paths. It is important to detail each possible occurrence and while the project does work, sometimes in a sneaky way I must add, it really made me think about the sequence of action which can possibly take place.

It might be a good idea, for future projets especially, to begin with a bit of planning, and an overarching structure of the codebase. Which functions are requiered, what they take as input and return as output. 

All this to say: an incredibly valuable, neat exprience driving me to delve into functional programming even more. And planning the codebase structure beforehand, unless the inspiration strikes maybe.
