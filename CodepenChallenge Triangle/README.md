# Dainty Danger Button

<!-- Proud result live [right here on codepen]() -->

## Preface

The second #codepenchallenge for the month of February is themed around triangles. I wasn't able to create a project in time, as the new round has actually begun a few hours ago, but nevertheless I chose to create an entry, to tinker with CSS and SVG. Also I just got an idea I wanted to really make into reality.

The project is rather straightforward: a button with an SVG element. An SVG element styled to resemble the musical instrument of a triangle. An SVG element animated to fake the triangle being played.

It is a small project, but still one that incorporates a couple of teaching moments and one that looks rather nice.
