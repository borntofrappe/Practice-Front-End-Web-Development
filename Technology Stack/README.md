# Preface 

The purpose of this project is the presentation of 5+ icons. Not in rows, not in columns, but around a point, on the contour of a circle.

It is partly an experimentation of something I had in mind for a different project and partly a way to present information in a 
not-so-standard design.

As I proceeded with the project, I realized how the design would actually result in a cumbersome design for small screen devices. To account for such a realization, the icons are shown by default in a wrapping wrap. When the screen is larger than an arbitrary amount (700px), the circular layout is included, through absolute positioning and the transform property.

Stylus proved to be incredibly useful to style each successive icon with very few lines of code.
