# 100 Days of Code Accountability Device

As to:

1. practice with **React**;

1. practice with new technologies such as **React Context** and libraries as **Styled Components**;

1. create something practical, or something at least I'd use with an almost daily frequenty.

I plan to create two React-powered applications. The first of which, unsurprisingly, a _twitter updater_ for the _100 days of code_ challenge.

## Preface

As I am currently involved in the 100 days of code challenge, I find myself posting my progress on a daily basis, right on twitter. While that is a tremendous way to make myself accountable, it is also a bother to constantly type the same hashtag over and over. I am pretty sure this is merely a problem I have, as a twitter newbie, but even solving the small issue of typing the #100daysofcode tag, I would still like a better, perhaps different way to share my efforts.

Such is the idea behind the updater in question. A simple tool allowing me to:

- type a string of text in a simple input;

- add tags by way of a submenu, collecting frequently used tags in a series of buttons. It'd be mightily helpful to have also a self-updating tag, in the form of R${round}D${day}, to increase the day as the challenges progresses.

## Preface

Since the project presents quite a new set of challenges, and perhaps and most importantly since I am a little bit rusty with the React framework, I plan to tackle the effort one bit at a time, and document my progress all the way through.

This practically means:

- design choices are limited to overarching, essential decisions, such as those related to the color of the background, of the text elements.

- features are developed one at a time, allowing for instance to only share on twitter a string of text, for starters.

## Update

While designing the UI in a simple HTML-CSS local environment, I got quite carried away and developed the application a bit more than expected.

In this longer-than-expected period, I got the idea to include a button, allowing to toggle between themes, a light and a dark theme. To enable such a functionality, I opened up a JavaScript file and before I realized it I basically developed the entire project in vanilla JS. You can find the working files in the "Vanilla JS" folder.

I still maintain creating the project with React is a good way to practice with the framework. On the basis of the working files, I therefore choose to replicate the project, perhaps optimizing a few traits.
