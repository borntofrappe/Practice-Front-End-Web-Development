# JS30 Compass

Working pen live, [right here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/oVxMmq).

## Preface

Inspired by the #javascript30 video on the compass and speedometer, I set out to create a relatively straightforward animation, leveraging makeshift data to produce a treasure map. There's a compass, but not actual data regarding the cardinal points. There's movement, but no actual acceleration based on how much the device is moving, if moving at all. Just a big, perhaps dashed X and a path element, with twist and turns leading up to said bold X. There's also a compass. Couldn't leave that one out, but it plays a smaller role. More than pertinent and visually striking, but a smaller role nonetheless.
