Proud result live [right here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/WmGjeG).

## Preface

The intent behind this project is to practice with JavaScript while trying to explain a concept of the same language. The concept in question, as explained in the [video from #javascript30](https://youtu.be/YnfwDQ5XYF4) inspiring this effort, is what happens when you try to assign the value of a variable to another variable.

At the end of the day is a helpful lesson in how to create a copy of an array or object. On top of that, an excellent pretext to create a slideshow-like interface allowing to explain a concept in multiple steps.
