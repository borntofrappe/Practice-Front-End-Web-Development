# Preface

This project sets out to create an almost belated entry for the weekly [#codepenchallenge](https://codepen.io/challenges/2018/july/). 

The topic of said challenge: the `<table>` element. 

My personal take: a shelf showcasing books on the different CSS techniques which allow to position HTML elements. Grid, flex, float, and perhaps even table. The shelf is itself built with the table element and connnected tags. I plan to show said shelf rotated as to show some depth. I plan to highlight the different books on hover. I plan to describe briefly and below the shelf the contents of each book. 

As I was building the simple project, I started to realize that not only it was a rather entertaining endeavor, but it could potentially extend its usefulness beyond the reach of the challenge. As I see it, the bookshelf concept could be a nifty way to present chapters or articles on a certain topic, and have the user pick and choose what to read from the list. Select above, read below.
