# Preface

For the weekly #codepenchallenge regarding SVG and signatures with SVG specifically, I wanted to create a not-so-random signature generator. 

Select how long and/or how curvy the signature should be, click a button, have the page randomly draw a path element in a selected area.

It is a challenging project, which demands quite some knowledge of the SVG syntax and the commands behind the `d` attribute of the `path` element. Luckily, I spent quite some time with the vector graphic format, so it is a project that, while demanding, I believe to be possible.

I have also a few concerns regarding the design of the page. Lately, I've been favouring a dark theme, repeating the #252525 color almost too often. Thusly, and for the project at hand, I a look around to other color and font choices is warranted. Perhaps on Dribble, or Codepen itself. 

# Design Choices

After a quick look-to-see, I decided to land on a couple of purple-ish hues:

- #463B89
- #6C51A4

These are used jointly in the background of the entire project and for the color of the text of the button, when pressed.

For the font, I wanted something clearly legible and clear, so I went with "Montserrat". I find the font strikes a nice balance with the mixture of purple and white colors. 

Rather happy with the end result.
