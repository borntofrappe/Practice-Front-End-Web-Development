# F1 Lap by Lap Feed

<!-- Link to the work-in-progress pen right [here](). -->

## Preface

Perhaps better labeled as F1 Lap by Lap dashboard, this project sets out to practice with React while re-creating the feature showcased every race weekend on the official F1 website.

In this feature, somebody pushes updates for the race, beginning before the actual start of the race and incrementing the number of updates to provide a careful commentary. I'd like to replicate this structure, but from the perspective of someone actually sending the updates. In light of this, and similarly to the input element showcased in my Accountability Booster, the application needs a way to consider user input. User input contemplating, at least at first, only text, but later expanding itself to perhaps markdown syntax and maybe even icons.

For a general overview of how the feed look like, the UI folder provides an HTML-CSS based first solution.
